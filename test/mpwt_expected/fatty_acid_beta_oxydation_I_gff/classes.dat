UNIQUE-ID - Regulation
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - This class describes most forms of protein, RNA or activity regulation.  Regulation can be either by a direct influence on the protein's activity 
/(e.g. allosteric inhibition of an enzyme) or by influencing the quantity of active protein available (e.g. by inducing or blocking its transcription 
/or translation).  The one form of regulation that is not covered by this class is when the quantity of a protein is regulated as a result of chemical 
/or binding reactions that either produce or consume the active form of a protein -- these are represented as Reactions instead.  There can be
/some ambiguity as to what should be represented as a reaction and what should be represented as a regulation event.  In general, an event that
/can be represented as a reaction should be when a) there is sufficiently detailed information known to model it as a reaction, b) both reactants
/and products exist as stable, independent entities, and c) our schema supports referring to both reactant and product of the reaction independently 
/and there is some justification for wanting to go down to that level of detail.  For example, a transcription factor bound to a small molecule will 
/generally have a different activity than the unbound transcription factor.  This could be represented either as the reaction TF + x -> TF-x or as 
/a regulation event in which x activates or inhibits the activity of TF.  However, because both TF and TF-x are stable molecules which can 
/potentially regulate different transcription units (not all will, but some do), or TF could bind another small molecule y and regulate yet another set 
/of transcription units, we prefer to model this kind of interaction as a reaction when the data is available.  On the other hand, an enzyme binding to 
/some inhibitor could also be represented as a reaction, but since there is rarely any reason to refer to the enzyme-inhibitor complex outside of
/the context of the reaction the enzyme catalyzes, we choose instead to model these events as regulation events in which the inhibitor regulates the
/activity of the enzyme.
/
/Instances of this class represent a one-to-one mapping between regulator and regulated-entity (i.e. an entity may regulate many processes,  or a
/process may be regulated by many entities, but each one requires its own instance of Regulation to represent it)
//
UNIQUE-ID - Enzymatic-Reactions
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - An instance of this class defines an association between an enzyme and
/a reaction that the enzyme catalyzes.  The slots of this class define
/information specific to that association, such as small molecules that
/act as cofactors of the catalysis of that
/reaction by that enzyme, and kinetic parameters of the enzyme.
/Enzymatic-Reactions also link via the Regulated-By slot to
/objects that define substrate-level regulation of this enzyme activity.
/It is improper to store that information with either the reaction or the
/enzyme because a given enzyme might catalyze multiple reactions,
/and a given reaction might be catalyzed by more than one enzyme.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - EC-BOOKKEEPING

//
UNIQUE-ID - Growth-Observations
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Instances of this class record observations of growth/no-growth for the wildtype organism and/or various gene knockouts.
/One instance of this frame can record whether a single organism (wildtype or knockout mutant) grows on a single growth medium,
/or, for purposes of compactness, it can record that a set of one or more knockouts (or wildtype) grows or does not grow on a 
/set of one or more growth media.  However, all knockouts or media grouped together in a single instance should be part of 
/a single experiment or coherent set of experiments (i.e. the same citations and comment applies to all), must describe growth at 
/a single temperature, and must all exhibit the same growth status (none, low or normal growth).
//
UNIQUE-ID - People
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - An instance of this class describes a person who has contributed information
/to a PGDB as a curator.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Compound-Mixtures
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Instances of this class are used to define sets of compounds, or mixtures.
/Example uses include describing the biomass composition of an organism for the purpose
/of computational analysis, and describing growth media.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Features
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Instances of of this class define a region of interest on a polypeptide, plus, 
/optionally, one or more states associated with the region.  Different subclasses are used to specify
/points, linear regions, and regions involving noncontiguous segments of an amino-acid chain.
/
/If there is a need to refer to two different states of a protein with a given feature (e.g. phosphorylated or
/unphosphorylated, metal-bound or not, crosslinked or not)  a Modified-Protein frame must be created
/that points back to the unmodified form.  Both forms of the protein point to the same feature, but the state
/annotation on the feature for each form indicates whether it is modified or not, or bound or not.  The state of a feature 
/can be left unspecified if it is not relevant to interactions of a particular protein form, and of course many 
/feature classes have no state.  The slot Possible-Feature-States indicates whether or not a feature class
/can have multiple states, and what those states are.
/
/For example, an instance F of this class could define an amino-acid residue that
/can be phosphorylated, plus the fact that this residue can take on two possible
/states: MODIFIED (i.e. phosphorylated) and UNMODIFIED (i.e. unphosphorylated).   The feature instance
/itself does not describe the state of a particular protein.  Instead, we would
/represent the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of a protein by
/creating two instances of class Proteins.  Both of those instances, in their
/FEATURES slot, would contain the value F, linking to the same feature
/instance.  However, in the two proteins, F would be annotated differently
/to indicate the state of that feature.   One protein would use an 
/annotation label STATE with a value MODIFIED to denote
/that the residue is phosphorylated, and would also be classified under the class Modified-Proteins,
/whereas the other would have the value UNMODIFIED for the state annotation.
/
/Most covalent modifications to proteins can be found in the subclass Modification-Features.  For these
/features, the specific class of the feature usually unambiguously defines the modification (if it does not,
/the chemical structure slots can be used for that purpose).  
/
/For cases in which a protein forms a non-covalent complex with some other entity, this is represented
/using an instance of the Complexes class.  In this case, a feature may be created to specify where on the protein
/the other entity binds (with the ATTACHED-GROUP slot indicating its identity), but it is rarely 
/necessary to indicate the state of the feature -- interactions refer to either the
/protein or the complex, but rarely need to distinguish between the complex, the protein within the complex, and the
/free protein.  If however it is necessary to distinguish between those three cases, then, as in the covalent modification
/case, a modified protein would need to be created, and the state (BOUND or UNBOUND) of the feature would need
/to be set for each form of the protein.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Gene-Ontology-Terms
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Class Gene-Ontology-Terms is the root of the Gene Ontology (GO).  In a PGDB,
/gene products (including monomers, multimers, and chemically modified forms
/thereof) are assigned to GO terms in this hierarchy.  Note that a PGDB does not contain
/the entire GO ontology, it contains only those terms (and their parents) to which gene products have been
/assigned.  To browse the entire GO ontology, visit the <a href="http://www.geneontology.org">GO website</a>.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Pseudo-Products
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - This class is a subclass of Frames because it does not make sense for it to be a subclass of anything else,
COMMENT - because Pseudo-Products do not actually exist.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Publications
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Instances of this class are publications, usually those cited within a PGDB.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Cell-Types
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - This class is used to distinguish between different types of cells within a single organism.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Organisms
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - The Organisms class is used in different ways in organism-specific
/PGDBs versus in multiorganism PGDBs such as MetaCyc.  The
/next paragraph discusses what is common to both types of PGDBs.
/Subsequent paragraphs describe the differences.
/
/In all PGDBs, subclasses of Organisms define biological taxa, at all
/possible taxonomic levels.  Class-subclass relationships between
/subclasses of Organisms describe their taxonomic relationships,
/since, for example, the class Bacteria includes as a subclass the
/class Alphaproteobacteria.  Generally, most of the taxonomic
/groups under Organisms correspond to entries from the NCBI Taxonomy 
/database (which is stored in its entirety in a separate Ocelot KB).  But in
/addition to taxa from NCBI Taxonomy, a PGDB can contain subclasses 
/for additional taxa that are not present in the NCBI Taxonomy. 
/
/Organism-specific PGDBs:  In an organism-specific PGDB, the only
/frames that exist as children of Organisms are those frames needed to
/describe the taxonomic lineage of the organism described by the PGDB.
/An organism-specific PGDB contains a single instance frame that
/describes information about the PGDB itself.  A parent class P of that 
/instance must exist to describe the lowest taxonomic group defined for the
/organism.  Additional parent classes exist as parents of P and
/children of Organisms that describe the other known taxonomic
/parents of P.  No other children of Organisms exist in the PGDB.
/
/Multiorganism PGDBs such as MetaCyc:  Multiorganism PGDBs contain
/no instances of class Organisms, but only subclasses of this class.  Those 
/subclasses define each of the different organisms for which MetaCyc
/(for example) defines pathways and enzymes.  For economy of storage, 
/only those taxa (and their parent taxa) actually referenced in the PGDB are
/stored in the PGDB, so that only a subset of the NCBI Taxonomy is 
/replicated in the PGDB. There is only one instance of  
/Multi-Organism-Groupings that describes the properties of the PGDB.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Polymer-Segments
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Describes a linear region of a polymer, such a a segment of a DNA 
/molecule or of an amino-acid chain.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Chemicals
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMON-NAME - a chemical
COMMENT - An instance of this class is a chemical entity of some type, including
/elements, small molecular weight chemical compounds, and
/macromolecules.  This class does not include fragments of 
/molecules, such as regions within a protein.

TYPES - FRAMES
//
UNIQUE-ID - Notes
TYPES - FRAMES
//
UNIQUE-ID - Evidence
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - The Evidence class defines a controlled vocabulary of evidence types.  Each term in the vocabulary 
/defines a type of evidence that pertains to an assertion in this database.  Example assertions include 
/the assertion that a pathway exists, or the assertion that an operon exists.  Example uses of the 
/evidence vocabulary are to record what type of evidence supports the assertion that an operon exists, 
/such as whether the evidence is based on a computational analysis or a wet-lab experiment, and if the 
/latter, what type of wet-lab experiment.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Collections
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - A group of frames, usually all of the same class, that are associated together in a single logical collection.  This is a utility class -- its only slot of its own is group-members.  Each of its subclasses will define a type of collection, and specify the class of frames that can be members.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Amino-Acid-Sites
TYPES - Protein-Features
COMMENT - Members of this class describe modifications to, binding to,or
/other interesting features of one or more specific (and generally 
/non-contiguous) amino acid residues in a polypeptide, as 
/opposed to a larger bounded region.  The set of residues
/defining the feature is encoded using slots RESIDUE-NUMBER
/(which lists the index within the amino-acid sequence of the
/indicated residue), and RESIDUE-TYPE (which lists the
/one-letter code of that residue).  The values of these two
/slots must be in parallel order.  The second slot is needed in
/cases where the full amino-acid sequence of the protein is not available.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Segments
TYPES - Polymer-Segments
TYPES - Protein-Features
COMMENT - Describes a feature that is a contiguous linear region of an amino-acid chain.  
/The location of the region is specified using slots LEFT-END-POSITION
/and RIGHT-END-POSITION.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Consensus-Growth-Results
TYPES - Growth-Observations
COMMENT - Instances of this class do not represent primary growth observations.  Rather, if there are multiple conflicting growth observations for a particular medium/knockout, then an instance of this class can be used to represent the consensus view of what the correct growth-status result should be for those conditions.  Generally at most one instance of this class will exist for a given medium/knockout/temperature combination.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Subatomic-Particles

COMMON-NAME - a subatomic particle
COMMENT - This class holds subatomic particles, such as an electron and a proton.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Non-Defined-Mixtures
TYPES - Compound-Mixtures
COMMENT - This class describes compound mixtures whose constituents cannot be fully specified, such as various kinds of cell extracts that are used in rich growth media.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Biomass-Compositions
TYPES - Compound-Mixtures
COMMENT - Biomass is described as a set of compounds, which together form a mixture.
/It is a target set of compounds, usually representative of key intermediates in the metabolism.
/In computational analysis, one often assumes the cell is alive if all the compounds
/in the biomass set can be produced from the compounds in a growth medium.
/The biomass set of compounds is listed in the COMPOSITION slot.

UNIQUE-ID - mRNA-Segments
TYPES - Polymer-Segments
COMMENT - This class defines segments within mRNA transcripts.  Although any given mRNA is a transcript of only
/a small portion of the replicon, for precision's sake, start and end locations of mRNA segments are defined relative to the start
/of the corresponding replicon, not relative to the start of the mRNA transcript.  This approach also
/allows us to avoid creation of frames for the transcripts themselves.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Paralogous-Gene-Groups

COMMENT - Each instance of this class describes a single group
/of paralogous genes.

UNIQUE-ID - Growth-Conditions
TYPES - Growth-Observations
COMMENT - Instances of this class describe the environmental conditions under which some set of data was collected.  These instances can be supplied as the value of the
/GROWTH-CONDITIONS slot (e.g. on transcriptional regulatory interactions) or the CONDITIONS annotation for environment-specific slots such as
/TRANSCRIPT-COPY-NUMBER.  The growth conditions that can be specified include temperature, pH, aerobicity, growth-media and gene knockouts (although the wildtype 
/organism is assumed by default).  Any description of environmental conditions that cannot be captured via these slots should be described using the COMMENT slot. It is not 
/necessary to specify a growth-status.

TYPES - Gene-Ontology-Terms
COMMON-NAME - cellular_component
SYNONYMS - GO:0008372
SYNONYMS - cell or subcellular entity
SYNONYMS - cellular component
COMMENT - Note that, in addition to forming the root of the cellular component ontology, this term is recommended for the annotation of gene products whose cellular component is unknown. When this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the cellular component of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code 'no data' (ND), is used to indicate this.

TYPES - Evidence
COMMON-NAME - Inferred by computational analysis
COMMENT - Inferred from computation.  The evidence for an assertion comes from a

TYPES - Evidence
COMMON-NAME - No biological data available
COMMENT - EV-ND is intended for use in GO annotations.
/
/Use of the EV-ND evidence code indicates that the annotator at the contributing database found no information
/that allowed making an annotation to any term indicating specific knowledge from the ontology in question
/(molecular function, biological process, or cellular component) as of the date indicated. This code should be used only
/for annotations to the root terms, molecular function ; GO:0003674, biological process ; GO:0008150, or cellular component ; GO:0005575,

//
UNIQUE-ID - GO:0003674
TYPES - Gene-Ontology-Terms
COMMON-NAME - molecular_function
SYNONYMS - GO:0005554
SYNONYMS - molecular function
COMMENT - Note that, in addition to forming the root of the molecular function ontology, this term is recommended for the annotation of gene products whose molecular function is unknown. When this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the molecular function of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code 'no data' (ND), is used to indicate this. Despite its name, this is not a type of 'function' in the sense typically defined by upper ontologies such as Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). It is instead a BFO:process carried out by a single gene product or complex.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Primary-Growth-Observations
TYPES - Growth-Observations
COMMENT - Instances of this class record primary observations of growth/no-growth for the wildtype organism and/or various gene knockouts,
/as described in the primary literature.
/One instance of this frame can record whether a single organism (wildtype or knockout mutant) grows on a single growth medium,
/or, for purposes of compactness, it can record that a set of one or more knockouts (or wildtype) grows or does not grow on a 
/set of one or more growth media.  However, all knockouts or media grouped together in a single instance should be part of 
/a single experiment or coherent set of experiments (i.e. the same citations and comment applies to all), must describe growth at 
/a single temperature, and must all exhibit the same growth status (none, low or normal growth).

COMMENT - Describes a feature that binds some other entity, such as a small molecule, site of some other protein, etc.
/Slot ATTACHED-GROUP specifies that entity.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Regulation-of-Translation
TYPES - Regulation
COMMENT - In this class of regulation, translation of an mRNA transcript is regulated to activate or inhibit formation of the
/corresponding protein.  Relevant regulatory mechanisms include those that directly interfere with or facilitate the translation process,
/as well as those involving processing of the mRNA transcript to promote or inhibit its degradation before translation.

UNIQUE-ID - CCO-BARRIER
TYPES - CCO
COMMON-NAME - barrier
//
UNIQUE-ID - Regulation-of-Enzyme-Activity
TYPES - Regulation
COMMENT - Instances of this class describe substrate-level modulation of enzyme activity.  The
/situation where a small molecule competitively inhibits an enzyme activity would
/be represented as follows:
/Regulator            = The small molecule
/Regulated-Entity = The enzymatic reaction for that enzyme activity
/Mechanism          = Competitive
/Mode                  = +
/
/Possible mechanisms and their definitions are as follows:
/Allosteric          -- Allosteric regulators increase or decrease the enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme and inducing a conformational change that alters the affinity of the enzyme to its substrates without affecting its VMAX.
/Competitive       -- Competitive inhibitors bind reversibly to the enzyme, preventing the substrate from binding.  Binding of the inhibitor and substrate are mutually exclusive because it is assumed that the inhibitor and substrate can both bind only to the free enzyme.
/Noncompetitive  -- Noncompetitive inhibitors can bind to either the free enzyme or to the enzyme-substrate complex.  The inhibitor and substrate may be bound to the enzyme simultaneously and do not exclude each other.  However, only the enzyme-substrate complex (not the enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex) is catalytically active.
/Uncompetitive    -- Uncompetitive inhibitors inhibit the enzyme by binding reversibly to the enzyme-substrate complex, but not to the enzyme alone.
/Mixed               -- Mixed inhibitors can bind to either the free enzyme or the enzyme-substrate complex, and decrease the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate.
/Irreversible        -- Irreversible inhibitors bind to the enzyme and dissociate so slowly that it is considered irreversible.  For example, alkylating agents such as iodoacetamide irreversibly inhibit the catalytic activity of some enzymes by modifying cysteine side chains.
/Other                -- Regulators that regulate the enzyme activity by a mechanism that has been characterized but cannot be clearly classified as one of the above mechanisms.
/
/If no mechanism is specified, then the mechanism is unknown, either because the mechanism has yet to be elucidated in the experimental literature, or because a full literature search has yet to be performed.

UNIQUE-ID - Activation-Inactivation-Interconversion
TYPES - Pathways
COMMON-NAME - Metabolite Activation/Inactivation/Interconversion
COMMENT - This class holds pathways for activation, inactivation, and interconversion of
/metabolic compounds.
/
/In contrast to a standard "biosynthesis" pathway in which a biologically active
/compound is synthesized from precursor molecules, activation pathways involve
/relatively minor chemical modifications to existing compounds that result in a
/substantial increase in their biological activity.
/
/Similarly, in contrast to standard "degradation" pathways in which a more complex
/compound is broken down into a set of simple metabolites, inactivation pathways
/involve relatively minor chemical modifications to existing biologically active
/compounds that result in a substantial decrease in their biological activity.
/
/
/Interconversion pathways describe the bidirectional conversion of a bio-molecule
/to a different form. The forward and backward conversions often result in
/significant changes in the biological activity of the compound, thus resulting in its
/activation and deactivation, respectively.
/
/These modifications may be either reversible or irreversible.

COMMENT - A site on a polypeptide in which a single residue is covalently modified.  Most subclasses
/of this class uniquely specify what the precise modification is (e.g. phosphorylation, methylation,
/etc.).  For cases in which the modification is known but cannot be uniquely specified using a

UNIQUE-ID - Transcription-Units
TYPES - DNA-Segments
COMMENT - An instance of this class defines a transcription unit, meaning a set of one
/or more genes that are transcribed to produce a single messenger RNA.  
/The differences between a transcription unit and an operon
/are (1) Technically, an operon must include more than one gene.  
/(2) An operon may include more than one promoter.  For operons that
/include multiple promoters, a transcription unit is defined for each promoter.
/
/A transcription unit should have as its components one or more genes,
/zero or one promoter, and zero or more terminators.  Transcription factor binding sites
/need not be components of a transcription unit.  A one-to-one correspondence is
/defined between a transcription unit and a promoter plus set of genes.  Promoters can
/be omitted if the transcription start site is unknown, in which case the correspondence
/is between a transcription unit and a set of genes.  Multiple terminators can be included 
/in a transcription-unit, but typically a separate transcription unit is defined for each 
/different set of transcribed genes (an exception is made for attenuators --
/generally no transcription unit is defined for the truncated transcript produced by
/attenuation, even if it includes the gene for a leader peptide).

UNIQUE-ID - Gene-Fragments
TYPES - DNA-Segments
COMMON-NAME - Gene-Fragments
COMMENT - This class is used when a single gene or pseudogene is made up of
/multiple fragments that are not adjacent on the chromosome.  Examples
/of when the use of gene-fragments is called for include a) when a
/pseudogene has been interrupted by one or more insertion elements so
/now comprises multiple non-contiguous segments, b) when a significant
/section of DNA (containing other genes) is excised before
/transcription, and a single transcript is produced from non-contiguous
/DNA segments, and c) to represent trans-splicing.  Gene fragment
/objects should NOT be created when a) a deletion results in a
/pseudogene that is nonfunctional because it is missing a portion of
/the gene, but still comprises a single segment (create this as a
/regular pseudogene instead), b) a gene product results from splicing
/together multiple exons within a single contiguous gene (use the
/CODING-SEGMENTS slot to represent that case instead), or c) when a
/gene or pseudogene contains an internal frame-shift or stop codon but
/still logically comprises a single contiguous extent of DNA.
/
/The sequence of a gene composed of Gene-Fragments is a concatenation
/of the sequences of all its fragments in the specified order (using
/their left-end-position and right-end-position slots, and
/reverse-complemented before concatenation if the gene is on the
/reverse strand). If a gene has Gene-Fragments, then the
/left-end-position and right-end-position slots of that gene must be
/empty.  Gene-Fragments cannot have Gene-Fragments of their own.  Each
/Gene-Fragment must have its own transcription-direction, in order to
/be able to represent cases of trans-splicing in which different
/fragments are on different strands.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Transcriptional-Attenuation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Transcription
COMMENT - This class describes the regulation of gene expression by transcription attenuation, or the premature termination of transcription.
/In all cases, the regulated-entity will be a terminator, although if precise terminator information is unknown then this frame may 
/alternatively be linked to a transcription-unit or gene.  When a terminator is specified, only genes in a transcription-unit that lie 
/downstream from the regulated terminator will have their expression regulated by instances of this class.
/
/Even though the regulated-entity may be a terminator, the value of the MODE slot refers to the overall effect on gene expression.
/Thus, a regulator that blocks termination at a terminator is considered an activator, and the value of the MODE slot will be "+",
/while a regulator that promotes termination is a repressor, with a value of "-" for the MODE slot.

SYNONYMS - protein containing complex
COMMENT - A protein complex in this context is meant as a stable set of interacting proteins which can be co-purified by an acceptable method, and where the complex has been shown to exist as an isolated, functional unit in vivo. Acceptable experimental methods include stringent protein purification followed by detection of protein interaction. The following methods should be considered non-acceptable: simple immunoprecipitation, pull-down experiments from cell extracts without further purification, colocalization and 2-hybrid screening. Interactions that should not be captured as protein complexes include: 1) enzyme/substrate, receptor/ligand or any similar transient interactions, unless these are a critical part of the complex assembly or are required e.g. for the receptor to be functional; 2) proteins associated in a pull-down/co-immunoprecipitation assay with no functional link or any evidence that this is a defined biological entity rather than a loose-affinity complex; 3) any complex where the only evidence is based on genetic interaction data; 4) partial complexes, where some subunits (e.g. transmembrane ones) cannot be expressed as recombinant proteins and are excluded from experiments (in this case, independent evidence is necessary to find out the composition of the full complex, if known). Interactions that may be captured as protein complexes include: 1) enzyme/substrate or receptor/ligand if the complex can only assemble and become functional in the presence of both classes of subunits; 2) complexes where one of the members has not been shown to be physically linked to the other(s), but is a homologue of, and has the same functionality as, a protein that has been experimentally demonstrated to form a complex with the other member(s); 3) complexes whose existence is accepted based on localization and pharmacological studies, but for which experimental evidence is not yet available for the complex as a whole.

/    <li> Functional complementation
/    <li> Inference about one gene drawn from the phenotype of a mutation in a different gene
/</ul><p>
/This category includes any combination of alterations in the sequence
/(mutation) or expression of more than one gene/gene product. This
/category can therefore cover any of the IMP experiments that are done
/in a non-wild-type background, although we prefer to use it only when
/all mutations are documented. When redundant copies of a gene must all
/be mutated to see an informative phenotype, use the IGI code. (Yes, 
/this implies some organisms, such as mouse, will have far, far more IGI
/than IMP annotations.)<p>
/
/IMP also covers phenotypic similarity: a phenotype that is informative
/because it is similar to that of another independent phenotype (which
/may have been described earlier or documented more fully) is IMP (not IGI).<p>

UNIQUE-ID - Compound-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Translation
COMMON-NAME - Small-Molecule-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
COMMENT - In this class of regulation, a small molecule directly activates or inhibits translation of the mRNA without requiring the mediation of a regulatory protein.  
/Typically, a region of the mRNA transcript (recorded in the slot Associated-Binding-Site) acts as a riboswitch or ribosensor and binds the regulating 
/molecule directly.  This induces a change in mRNA secondary structure that blocks or unblocks the ribosome binding site, or interferes in some other 
/way with the translation initiation process.  Alternatively, the small molecule can act by causing or preventing the targeting of the transcript for 
/degradation, or by translational attenuation, interacting with the ribosome to cause or prevent premature termination of translation.  The Mode slot records
/the specific regulation mechanism, if known.
/
/In instances of this class, the regulated entity will generally be a transcription unit, since the transcription unit defines the mRNA transcript whose
/translation is being regulated (although it is also possible for the regulated entity to be an individual gene).  The regulator will be a small molecule.

UNIQUE-ID - RNA-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Translation
COMMENT - In this class of regulation, a small regulatory RNA binds to a roughly complementary region on the mRNA transcript (specified
/in slot Associated-Binding-Site), possibly with the aid of one or more chaperones or accessory proteins (specified in slot
/Accessory-Proteins), to regulate translation.  Regulation may be by directly interfering with translation (for example,
/by directly blocking or by inducing some change in secondary structure that blocks or unblocks the ribosome binding site), by
/causing (or preventing) the mRNA to be targeted for degradation, or by some combination of the two.  The Mechanism slot
/is used to indicate which of the above two mechanisms of action are involved, if known.  If a specific RNAse is specified
/in slot Associated-RNAse, then the sRNA targets the mRNA to be degraded by that particular RNAse.
/
/In instances of this class, the regulated entity will be a transcription unit, since the transcription unit defines the mRNA transcript
/whose translation is being regulated.  The regulator will be an sRNA.

UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Translation
COMMENT - In this class of regulation, a regulatory protein activates or inhibits translation of the mRNA.   The protein can directly interfere with translation initiation
/by binding to the mRNA transcript (at a location recorded in the slot Associated-Binding-Site) and either directly blocking the ribosome binding site, or
/by inducing a change in secondary structure that blocks or unblocks the ribosome binding site or interferes in some other way with the translation initiation
/pathway.  Alternatively, the protein can process the transcript in some way to cause or prevent its targeting for degradation.  A third option is that by 
/translational attenuation, the protein can interact with the ribosome to cause or prevent premature termination of translation.  The Mode slot records the 
/specific regulation mechanism, if known.
/
/In instances of this class, the regulated entity will generally be a transcription unit, since the transcription unit defines the mRNA transcript whose

//
UNIQUE-ID - Interconversion
TYPES - Activation-Inactivation-Interconversion
COMMON-NAME - Metabolite Interconversion
COMMENT - This class contains interconversion pathways. These pathways describe the
/bidirectional conversion of a bio-molecule to a different form. The forward and
/backward conversions often result in significant changes in the biological activity
/of the compound, thus resulting in its activation and deactivation, respectively.
/
/Interconversion pathways are different from biosynthetic or degradative cyclic
/pathways in the fact that the main components lack an input and/or output flux. For example, the
/purpose of the |FRAME: CALVIN-PWY "Calvin Cycle"|, which is a biosynthetic cycle, is CO<sub>2</sub>
/fixation. As the cycle turns there is a net input of carbon dioxide and net output
/of fructose 6-phosphate. In the interconversion pathway |FRAME:PWY-2345|, on
/the other hand, the purpose of the cycle is simply to convert the compounds
/genistein, genistin and malonylgenistin to each other in a reversible manner, so as the cycle turns, there is no net changes in the concentrations of these compounds. Note that other compounds that participate in these pathways (side compounds) do have input and output fluxes. For example, in the |FRAME:PWY-2345| pathway |FRAME: CPD-12575| enters the pathway in each cycle, and is converted to |FRAME:  Glucopyranose| and |FRAME:  UDP|.

UNIQUE-ID - Polyketide-Synthases
TYPES - Proteins
COMMON-NAME - a polyketide synthase
SYNONYMS - a PKS
COMMENT - Polyketide synthases (PKSs) are a family of multi-domain enzymes or enzyme complexes that produce polyketides, a large class of secondary metabolites produced in bacteria, fungi, plants, and a few animal lineages.
/
/Polyketide synthases are classified into three groups:
/
/1. Type I polyketide synthases are very large, highly modular, homodimeric proteins. They comprise multiple modules, each consisting of several domains separated by short spacer regions and fulfilling different catalytic steps. The minimal composition of a type I PKS module includes an acyltransferase (AT) domain, a keto synthase (KS) domain, and an acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain. An exception are the <i>trans</i>-AT PKSs, which lack AT domains and rely on free-standing AT domains to provide this functionality. Dimerization is essential for the function of multimodular polyketide synthases, though only the KS domains require dimerization for their activity |CITS: [23489133]|.
/
/2. Type II polyketide synthases are complexes of monofunctional proteins.  The smallest possible type II PKS complex consists of three proteins - an ACP, a ketosynthase (KS&alpha;) and a ketosynthase chain length factor (KSCLF, CLF, or KS&beta;). The combined action of these units fulfills a similar function as the AT, KS and ACP domains in type I PKSs |CITS: [17268612]|.
/
/3. Type III polyketide synthases are small homodimers that do not use acyl-carrier protein (ACP) domains. Instead they use a free acyl-CoA substrate for chain elongation |CITS: [27862822]|.
/
/Typical domains of type I PKSs include: acyltransferase (AT), acyl carrier protein (ACP), keto-synthase (KS), ketoreductase (KR), dehydratase (DH), enoylreductase (ER), methyltransferase (MT), PLP-dependent cysteine lyase (SH), and thioesterase (TE). Other, less common domains, are also found.
/
/A typical reaction of a PKS starts with the binding of a starter unit (usually acetyl-CoA, although many other starter unitts are known). The nascent polyketide chain is handed over from the ACP domain of one module to the KS domain of the next module, in a reaction catalyzed by the KS domain. An extender group, usually malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA, is loaded onto the current ACP domain by the current AT domain. The extender group then reacts in a Claisen condensation with the KS-bound nascent polyketide chain, at the KS-bound end of the chain, resulting in an elongated chain and the release of a CO<sub>2</sub> molecule. Other domains, such as the KR, DH, MT etc can act on the product, introducing or reducing double bonds, removing hydroxyl groups, adding methyl groups, etc. The elongation cycle repeats until the the product reaxhes the TE domain, which hydrolyzes the completed polyketide chain from the PKS |CITS: [27266330]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Cobamides "A cobamide"| is a corrinoid molecule based on the structure of |FRAME: CPD-20843|, a cobalt-corrinoid hexaamide that is formed from |FRAME: COBINAMIDE| by the attachment of an &alpha;-D-ribofuranose 3-phosphate residue at the 2 position of the aminopropanol chain. Cobamides serve as cofactors for a number of important enzymes.
/
/A key structural feature of cobinamides is a corrin ring with a cobalt ion in its center. Four of the six coordination sites of the cobalt ion are provided by the corrin ring, while the other two are provided by |FRAME: Cobamide-Upper-Ligands upper| (&beta;) and |FRAME: Cobamide-Lower-Ligands lower| (&alpha;) ligands, which are located above and below the ring plane, respectively. The best known cobamide, |FRAME: Cobalamins cobalamin|, contains |FRAME: DIMETHYLBENZIMIDAZOLE| as the lower ligand and either a methyl group or 5'-deoxyadenosyl group as the upper ligand.
/
/At least 16 different cobamides with structural variability in the lower ligand have been described. The 16 bases reported so far are |FRAME: BENZIMIDAZOLE|, |FRAME: CPD-18320|, |FRAME: CPD-18321|, |FRAME: CPD-18497|, |FRAME: CPD-18495|, |FRAME: DIMETHYLBENZIMIDAZOLE|, |FRAME: ADENINE|, |FRAME: CPD-18323|, |FRAME: GUANINE|, |FRAME: HYPOXANTHINE|, |FRAME: PHENOL|, |FRAME: CPD-108|, |FRAME: CPD-5723|, |FRAME: CPD-20865|, |FRAME: CPD-20864|, and |FRAME: CPD-20885|  |CITS: [24055007]|. Different cobamides may not be functionally equivalent as cofactors for cobamide-dependent enzymes |CITS: [14351147][13796808][13796809][21696461][22923412][23417488]|.

/region on the leader transcript to either stabilize or block the formation of an antiterminator, thus preventing 
/or allowing formation of the competing terminator, and consequently activating or inhibiting transcription.  
/Examples include the binding of an uncharged tRNA to a T box region on the leader transcript to stabilize an 
/antiterminator, or the pairing of an antisense RNA with its complementary strand to block antiterminator formation.  
/The regulator in these cases is an RNA and the regulated-entity is the terminator.

/
/The first nitrile to be synthesized (in 1782 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele) was that of formate, |FRAME: HCN|, which is an extremely toxic compound (it is an inhibitor of |FRAME: EC-7.1.1.9|). The name nitrile originates from the nitrile of benzoate, |FRAME: CPD-15582|, which was synthesized in 1844 by Hermann Fehling. Fehling named the compound nitrile, and the name was subsequently applied for all organic compounds that contain a cyano group.
/
/Nitriles occur naturally in many organisms, and over 120 naturally occurring nitriles have been isolated. It is particularly common in fruit seeds. The cyano group is very stable and is not readily metabolized.

UNIQUE-ID - Ribosome-Mediated-Attenuation
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, the intracellular level of a charged tRNA determines whether or not the ribosome
/pauses while synthesizing a leader peptide.  The pause site consists of a series of one or more codons for a 
/particular amino acid.  The ribosome, which moves sequentially along the transcript, synthesizing protein, must 
/wait for a tRNA charged with that amino acid before it can proceed further.  Thus, the intracellular level
/of that amino acid determines how much charged tRNA is available, and therefore whether or not the 
/ribosome pauses.  The newly forming mRNA transcript can adopt one of two competing stem-loop conformations, a
/terminator or an antiterminator structure.  In all cases described so far, pausing favors the formation of
/an antiterminator structure, thus preventing terminator formation, and allowing gene expression.  The regulator
/in this case will be the particular charged tRNA, and the regulated-entity is the terminator.

/However, in respiration the electrons do not pass directly from the donor to the
/acceptor. Instead, they pass a number of membrane-bound electron carriers that
/function as a transport chain, passing the electrons from one to another in steps
/that follow the electrochemical gradients between the electron donor and the
/acceptor.
/
/Each oxidized member of the electron transfer chain (which can be
/|FRAME: Flavoproteins|, |FRAME: ETR-Quinones|, |FRAME: Cytochromes|, or other
/type of electron carrier) can be reduced by the reduced form of the preceding

UNIQUE-ID - Non-ribosomal-peptide-synthetases
TYPES - Proteins
COMMON-NAME - a non-ribosomal peptide synthase
SYNONYMS - an NRPS
COMMENT - The biosynthetic system for the production of |FRAME: Nonribosomal-Peptides| operates nucleic acid-free at the protein level. The specific condensation of amino acids and related carboxyl containing compounds is directed by protein templates, and each biosynthetic step generally requires a protein module. A minimal configuration consists of an adenylation domain for amino acid activation, a thiolation domain for transfer of activated intermediates, and a condensation domain.
/
/Domains and modules are assembled at the gene level into gene clusters, which are translated into multifunctional proteins or multi-enzyme complexes, and post-translationally modified by addition of |FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P| to the thiolation domain |CITS: [16774586]|.
/
/Since a minimal module requires 33.5 kbp of genetic sequence, and since most non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) consist of several such modules, some NRPS genes are the largest known genes |CITS: [15487945]|.
/
/Unlike the related |FRAME: Polyketide-Synthases "polyketide synthases"|, which require dimerization for function, non-ribosomal peptide synthases are monomeric |CITS: [12323374][22802156]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Corrinoid-Adenosyltransferases
TYPES - Proteins
COMMON-NAME - a [corrinoid adenosyltransferase]
COMMENT - Corrinoid adenosyltransferases catalyze an adenosylation reaction in which the Co(I) ion of the corrinoid substrate conducts a nucleophilic attack on the adenosyl moiety of ATP, which leaves it in a Co(III) state.
/some of these enzymes can accept a number of substrates including |FRAME:CPD-694|, |FRAME:COBINAMIDE | and |FRAME:COB-I-ALAMIN|, and can also accept other nucleotides, including |FRAME: CTP|, |FRAME: UTP| and |FRAME: GTP| (in decreasing order of activity).
/
/One of these reactions, involving |FRAME:CPD-694|, is an integral part of the <i>de novo</i> adenosylcobalamin biosynthesis pathway (see |FRAME:PWY-5507|). The other reactions are important in vitamin B12 salvage pathways (such as |FRAME:COBALSYN-PWY|) |CITS: [2403541]|.
/
/The actual substrate for the enzymatic reaction is |FRAME: COB-I-ALAMIN|, in which the cobalt ion has a valency of +1. However, |FRAME: COB-I-ALAMIN| is very reactive, and, if left unprotected, is rapidly oxidized to |FRAME: CPD-1829|. The midpoint redox potential of the Co<sup>2+</sup>/Co<sup>1+</sup> couple is -610 mV, which is is too low for any known cellular reductant |CITS: [4489]|.
/Remarkably, the enzyme is able to overcome this thermodynamic barrier. After binding the corrinoid substrate an aromatic amino acid residue displaces the lower ligand |CITS: [19236001]|, generating a four-coordinate |FRAME: CPD-1829| intermediate, the reduction potential of which is higher by >250 mV than the free compound, bringing it within physiological range |CITS: [15954777][15913339][18672897]|. The cobalt is subsequently reduced to the +1 valence. The source of the electron used for the reduction of the enzyme-bound |FRAME: CPD-1829| to |FRAME: COB-I-ALAMIN| <i>in vivo</i> has not been established. However, CobA was shown to interact <i>in vitro</i> with flavodoxin A (FldA), and reduced FldA was shown to efficiently drive the adenosylation of cob(II)alamin |CITS: [11408479][16207720]|. Furthermore, free reduced flavins and non-specific flavoproteins can also reduce cob(II)alamin bound in the active site of the enzyme, leading to the suggestion that bona fide cobalamin reductases may not be necessary |CITS: [19933577]|.
/
/Three types of corrinoid adenosyltransferases that share no sequence similairty have been reported so far, all of which are found in the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-90371|. |FRAME: G-10061 CobA| is produced continuously to maintain basal concentrations of |FRAME: ADENOSYLCOBALAMIN|, while the other two enzymes, encoded by the |FRAME: STM2050| and |FRAME: STM2467| genes, provide the |FRAME: ADENOSYLCOBALAMIN| cofactor for |FRAME: EC-4.2.1.28|, and |FRAME: EC-4.3.1.7|, respectively, and are induced by the substrates of these enzymes (|FRAME: PROPANE-1-2-DIOL| and |FRAME: ETHANOL-AMINE|, respectively). The mammalian enzyme, encoded by the |FRAME: HS13779| gene, belongs to the PduO type.

COMMENT - An aromatic compound contains one or more aromatic rings (an aromatic ring is a planar ring in which every atom must have an occupied p orbital, which overlaps with p orbitals on either side). The pi orbitals of the ring's atoms form a conjugated system and are in resonance, giving increased stability compared to saturated compounds having a similar structure. As a result aromatic rings are very stable and do not break apart easily. The least complex aromatic hydrocarbon is benzene.
/
/The name stems from a time when compounds were characterized by their smell rather than their chemical structure.
/
/Similar structures in which at least one of the ring's carbon atoms  is replaced by one of the heteroatoms oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur, are called heteroarenes.

UNIQUE-ID - Opines
TYPES - Organooxygen-Compounds
COMMON-NAME - an opine
COMMENT - |FRAME: Opines Opines| are a large family of low molecular weight compounds. The vast majority of opines are secondary amine derivatives resulting from the reduction of the imine formed by condensation of an amino acid with either a keto acid or a sugar. Opines from the |FRAME: CPD-308| family are formed when |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE| serves as the keto substrate in the condensation reaction, while those of the |FRAME: CPD-309| family are formed when |FRAME: PYRUVATE| is involved in the condensation reaction. Opines of the |FRAME: CPD-15773| and |FRAME: CPD-26410| families are formed by the condensation of an amino acid with a sugar.
/
/A small, separate class of opines is the |FRAME: Agrocinopines agrocinopines|, which are sugar-phosphodiesters (e.g., |FRAME: CPD-15774|, which is a phosphodiester of sucrose and L-arabinose).
/
/While opines are found in marine invertebrates, fungi, higher plants and mammals, they are most commonly found in plant crown gall tumors or hairy root tumors, where they are produced by bacteria of the genera |FRAME: TAX-357| and |FRAME: TAX-379|, respectively. However, the first opine to be identified (in 1927), octopine, was isolated from an octopus muscle, hence its name, which was later extended for naming the opine family.
/
/Biosynthesis of opines in crown gall tumors is performed by enzymes encoded by genes contained in T-DNA (transfer DNA), which is part of the Ti plasmid (in |FRAME: TAX-357|) or Ri plasmid (in |FRAME: TAX-379|). The plasmids are inserted by the bacteria into the plant genome, where they are integrated and expressed. Those opines are used by the bacteria as energy, carbon and nitrogen sources. Each strain of |FRAME: TAX-357| and |FRAME: TAX-379| induces and catabolizes a specific set of opines, determined by the specific Ti or Ri plasmid they possess, and Ti-plasmids are classified as nopaline-type, octopine-type, agropine-type, vitopine-type, succinamopine-type, and chrysopine-type |CITS: [31386108]|. Over 30 different opines have been described.

TYPES - Polyketide-Synthases
COMMON-NAME - a <i>holo</i> acp domain within a [polyketide synthase]
COMMENT - Polyketide synthases (PKSs) are found in soil and marine filamentous bacteria, as well as in fungi and higher plants, and are responsible for producing such therapeutically important natural products as erythromycin and lovastatin. Analogous to the fatty acid synthases, PKSs can be divided to two types: multifunctional polyproteins (type I) and discrete protein (type II).
/
/Type I PKSs are organized into modular complexes, each catalyzing individual chain elongation steps using an associated carrier protein. The minimal type I PKS module consists of 3 domains: a ketosynthase, a acyltransferase, and an ACP. The acyltransferase domain catalyzes the priming of the flanking ACP domain with the appropriate substrate.
/
/Type II PKS ACPs, on the other hand, possess catalytic self-acylation activity |CITS: [18059524]|.
/
/ACP proteins are synthesized in their |FRAME: apo-ACP "<i>apo</i> inactive form"|, and are activated by attachment of a |FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P| moiety, removed from |FRAME: CO-A|, to an |FRAME: SER| residue, in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-2.7.8.7| (4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase) |CITS: [18059524]|.

//
UNIQUE-ID - MCD-Chaperones
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - a cytidylyl molybdenum cofactor chaperone
SYNONYMS - an MCD cofactor chaperone
COMMENT - Many enzymes depend on the sulfo-form of molybdenum cofactor (MoCo). The so called maturation of MoCo involves the addition of sulfur to the Mo center, replacing an oxo group. In eukaryotes this reaction is catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-2.8.1.9| (e.g. the plant ABA3) |CITS: [11553608][15561708]|. However, prokaryotes do not have such an enzyme. In prokaryotes MoCo first binds to a chaperone (such as XdhC) before it is sulfurylated by |FRAME: EC-2.8.1.7|. Many of the prokaryotic molybdoenzymes have a specific chaperone |CITS: [23201473]|. The chaperones interact with the desulfurase, so that MoCo is sulfurated while it is still bound to the chaperone and before the insertion into the target protein. Binding to the chaperone stabilizes the sulfurated form of MoCo. Once sulfurylated, the chaperone transfer the cofactor to its target protein |CITS: [17649978]|.

UNIQUE-ID - ANAEROBIC-RESPIRATION
TYPES - Respiration
COMMON-NAME - Anaerobic Respiration
COMMENT - Like |FRAME: Fermentation fermentation|, respiration is a process by which
/electrons are passed from an electron donor to a terminal electron acceptor.
/However, in respiration the electrons do not pass directly from the donor to the
/acceptor. Instead, they pass a number of membrane-bound electron carriers that
/function as a transport chain, passing the electrons from one to another in steps
/that follow the electrochemical gradients between the electron donor and the
/acceptor.
/
/Each oxidized member of the electron transfer chain (which can be
/|FRAME: Flavoproteins|, |FRAME: ETR-Quinones|, |FRAME: Cytochromes|, or other
/type of electron carrier) can be reduced by the reduced form of the preceding
/member, and the electrons flow through the chain all the way to the terminal
/acceptor, which could be |FRAME: OXYGEN-MOLECULE| in the case of
/|FRAME: AEROBIC-RESPIRATION "aerobic respiration"|, or another type of molecule in
/|FRAME: ANAEROBIC-RESPIRATION "anaerobic respiration"|.
/
/Known terminal acceptors involved in anaerobic respiration include organic
/compounds (|FRAME: FUM|, |FRAME: DMSO|, or |FRAME: TRIMETHYLAMINE-N-O|),
/or inorganic compounds (|FRAME: NITRATE|, |FRAME: NITRITE|,
/|FRAME: NITROUS-OXIDE|, |FRAME: CHLORATE|, |FRAME: CPD0-1385|,
/|FRAME: MN+3 "oxidized manganese ions"|, |FRAME: FE+3 "ferric iron"|, gold,
/|FRAME: SELENATE|, |FRAME: ARSENATE|, |FRAME: SULFATE| and
/|FRAME: Elemental-Sulfur "elemental sulfur"|).
/
/During the process of electron transfer, a proton gradient is formed across the
/membrane due to three potential processes
/
/1. The use of some of the energy associated with the electron transfer for active
/pumping of protons across a membrane.
/
/2. Exporting protons out of the cell during electron-to-hydrogen transfers.
/
/3. Scalar reactions that consume protons on one side of a membrane, or produce them
/on the other side of the membrane, without actually moving a proton from one
/compartment to another.
/
/Upon passage of protons back into the cytoplasm, they drive multisubunit
/|FRAME: EC-7.1.2.2 "ATP synthase"| enzymes that generate ATP.

UNIQUE-ID - CcmCDE-Complex
TYPES - Protein-Complexes
COMMON-NAME - a CcmCDE complex
COMMENT - Cytochrome <i>c</i> biogenesis in archaea and most Gram-negative bacteria occurs via a complicated pathway known as "system I". Most of the proteins involved in this pathway are encoded by the <i>ccmABCDEFGH</i> genes.
/
/|FRAME: CcmE-Proteins CcmE| is periplasmic heme chaperone |CITS: [9712585][9770295]| that forms a trimeric complex with the |FRAME: CcmD-Proteins CcmD| small membrane protein and the |FRAME: CcmC-Proteins CcmC| heme-binding membrane protein. CcmC contains six transmembrane domains and a large periplasmic domain that contains a WWD motif that binds heme. In addition, CcmC has two histidines flanking the WWD motif that serve as axial ligands to the heme.
/
/Once heme is bound to the WWD motif of CcmC, a spontaneous covalent bond forms between the 2-vinyl group of the heme and a histidine residue of CcmE |CITS: [15465823][15771504][16373344]|. Concomitantly the heme's iron is oxidized to the (III) valency |CITS: [19629033]|. While being covalently bound to CcmE, the heme is still bound non-covalently to CcmC..
/
/The heme-bound CcmE is released from the complex upon the binding of the |FRAME: CcmAB-Complex "CcmAB complex"|, leaving a |FRAME: CcmABCD-Complex "CcmABCD complex"| |CITS: [16824107]|. The freed CcmE then delivers the heme to the CcmF protein, which reduced the iron back to Fe<sup>2+</sup> and attaches the heme to apocytochrome <i>c</i>.

UNIQUE-ID - Prolipoproteins
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - a prolipoprotein
COMMENT - The broad definition of a |FRAME: Lipoproteins lipoprotein| is a protein to which lipids are bound. Many enzymes, transporters, structural proteins, antigens, adhesins, and toxins are lipoproteins, including the high-density (HDL) and low-density (LDL) lipoproteins that carry fats in the blood stream.
/The lipoprotein known as |FRAME: EG10544-MONOMER| (Lpp) is considered the most abundant protein in |FRAME: TAX-562| and accounts for more than 40% of the peptidoglycan on a weight basis. It is necessary for the stabilization and integrity of the bacterial cell envelope and is thought to physically tether the outer membrane to the peptidoglycan layer |CITS:[4899922][4565677][4578317]|.
/
/Membrane-attached lipoproteins of Gram-negative bacteria and Mycobacteria are tethered to the membrane by an <i>N</i>-acyl-(<i>S</i>-diacylglyceryl)-cysteine anchor that is variably acylated depending on the genus. In many Gram-positive bacteria certain variations exist (see below).
/
/In bacteria all lipoproteins are initially translated as precursors (|FRAME: Prolipoproteins prolipoproteins|) containing an N-terminal signal peptide that contains a conserved lipobox motif sequence preceding a cysteine residue |CITS: [12876315][19367716]|. Once transported to the outer face of the membrane, |FRAME: EC-2.5.1.145| (Lgt) attaches a diacylglycerol moiety from a phospholipid donor by a thioether bond to the cysteine residue |CITS: [8051048]|.
/In most organisms |FRAME: EC-3.4.23.36| (Lsp) then cleaves the leader peptide leaving the cysteine as the N-terminal amino acid of the protein |CITS: [7040395]|. However, it has been found that in |FRAME: TAX-2115| the peptide is cleaved two amino acids away from the cysteine (towards the N-terminus) |CITS: [22303020]|.
/In Gram-negative bacteria biosynthesis is completed by |FRAME: EC-2.3.1.269| (Lnt), which transfers a fatty acid from a membrane phospholipid to form an amide linkage with the N-terminus of the cysteine residue, generating a triacylated molecule |CITS: [2032623]|.
/
/More variety is found in some low GC Gram-positive bacteria. Three new forms have been observed - a |FRAME: Peptidyl-Form-Lipoprotein-N-terminus "peptidyl form"| (which results from the alternative cleaving by Lsp, with two amino acids present before the lipid-modified cysteine residue, which is described above), an |FRAME: N-Acetyl-Lipoprotein "<i>N</i>-acetyl form"|, and an <i>N</i>-acylated monoacyl-glyceryl form known as the |FRAME: Lyso-Form-Lipoprotein-Cysteine "lyso-form"| |CITS: [22135097][22303020][28320885]|.

COMMENT - 3-Mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (TUM1, MPST, tRNA thiouridin modification protein 1) belongs to an enzyme superfamily of proteins that contain a rhodanese-like domain.
/
/The enzyme was initially found to catalyze the reaction of |FRAME: EC-2.8.1.2|. During this reaction the enzyme catalyzes a transsulfuration of |FRAME: 3-MERCAPTO-PYRUVATE| |CITS: [16107337]|, forming |FRAME: PYRUVATE| and an enzyme-bound persulfide, which can be released as H<sub>2</sub>S in the presence of reducing systems like GSH or thioredoxin |CITS: [21732914]|.
/
/In addition to that function, the enzyme was reported to mediate the transfer of sulfur from the NFS1 L-cysteine desulfurase to other sulfurtransferase (Uba4p in yeast and MOCS3 in humans), as part of a sulfur relay chain that is responsible for the 2-thiolation of certain tRNAs in the cytosol |CITS: [19151091]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Siderophore
TYPES - Biological-Roles
TYPES - Secondary-Metabolites
COMMON-NAME - a siderophore
COMMENT - Although iron is extremely abundant on Earth, its solubility is very low at physiological pH in aerobic environments. While iron(II) is souble, it is rapidly oxidized in the presence of oxygen into insoluble ferric oxyhydroxides. In addition, iron is often complexed with organic molecules. The concentration of free iron in body fluids is estimated to be about 10<sup>-18</sup> M |CITS: [12655062]|. The most common iron uptake mechanism used by microorganisms are ferrisiderophore acquisition systems.
/
/Siderophores are small organic compounds with a very high affinity for iron. Once secreted into the environment, siderophores efficiently solubilize and chelate iron(III). The iron-siderophore complexes (ferrisiderophores) are imported back into the cell by specific transport systems, crossing both the outer and inner membranes |CITS: [23046646]|. Once in the cytoplasm (and in some cases, in the periplasm), iron is released from siderophores by hydrolysis, proton-assisted dissociation of the complex, or reduction of the metal center |CITS: [23443998]|.
/
/Siderophores are very common in pathogenic bacteria, since iron in the host organism is usually tightly bound to proteins, resulting in an extremely low concentration of free iron in the blood.
/
/More than 500 different siderophores have now been identified. The most common siderophore use hydroxamate and/or catechol functions, attached to either linear or cyclic scaffolds, to form a hexadentate structure. Siderophore with lower denticity (tetradentate, tridentate, and bidentate) are also produced, but have a much lower affinity toward iron(III). In general, all siderophores possess a higher affinity for iron(III) than for iron(II) |CITS: [20376388]|.
/
/Most siderophores belong to one of three major groups: the |FRAME: Catecholate-siderophores "catechols"|, |FRAME: Hydroxamate-siderophores "hydroxamates"| and |FRAME: Thiazoline-siderophores "thiazolines"|. Other groups include |FRAME: Phenolate-Siderophores "phenolate siderophores"| and |FRAME: Carboxylate-siderophores "carboxylate siderophores"|. Many siderophores contain more than one type of functional groups.
/
/Some grasses are known to make siderophores as well. These |FRAME: Phytosiderophores "phytosiderophores"| are also known as mugineic acids.

COMMENT - ArsC cytoplasmic arsenate reductases are found widely in microbes |CITS: [15691908]|. Several different clades of microbial ArsC proteins have been described. Some share no sequence similarity, indicating parallel evolution.
/
/The first clade includes the glutathione-glutaredoxin-coupled enzymes (|FRAME: EC-1.20.4.1|), and is found in many Gram-negative bacteria, as well as carried on many plasmids (for example, see the |FRAME: TAX-83333| |FRAME: EG12237-MONOMER|).

/
/A third clade, described from cyanobacteria, is a hybrid enzyme that is related to thioredoxin-dependent arsenate reductases but requires the GSH/glutaredoxin system for restoring the active state of the enzyme following catalysis |CITS: [14617642][26224634]|.
/
/A fourth clade consists of mycothiol-dependent system (|FRAME: EC-2.8.4.2| and |FRAME: EC-1.20.4.3|). That system was described from the Gram-positive bacterium |FRAME: TAX-1718|.
/
/A fifth clade includes the eukaryotic |FRAME: CPLX-6362| of |FRAME: TAX-4932|, which is also glutaredoxin- and glutathione-dependent. The yeast gene is named |FRAME: G3O-34320| rather than arsC.

COMMON-NAME - cob(I)alamin-[methionine synthase]
COMMENT - |FRAME: EC-2.1.1.13| is a vitamin B12-dependent zinc metalloenzyme that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from |FRAME: 5-METHYL-THF-GLU-N| to homocysteine.
/
/Methionine synthase is one of two eukaryotic enzymes that require a cobalamin prosthetic group for activity. Unlike the other enzyme (|FRAME: EC-5.4.99.2|), which requires adenosylcobalamin, the cobalamin cofactor of methionine synthase needs to be methylated. Upon the initial transfer of a cob(II)alamin cofactor from a |FRAME: CPD-20918|, it is methylated to the active methylcob(III)alamin form by |FRAME: EC-1.16.1.8|, which uses |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| as the methyl donor. The methyl group is subsequently transferred to homocysteine to form methionine, leaving the cofactor briefly in a cob(I)alamin form, which is regenerated to the active methylcob(III)alamin form by a transfer of a methyl group from |FRAME: 5-METHYL-THF-GLU-N "5-methyltetrahydrofolate"| |CITS: [2407589]|.
/
/The enzyme becomes inactivated occasionally during its cycle by oxidation of Co(I) to Co(II). Reactivation by reductive methylation is catalysed by the enzyme itself, with S-adenosyl-L-methionine as the methyl donor and a reducing system. For the mammalian enzyme, the reducing system involves NADPH and |FRAME: EC-1.16.1.8|. In bacteria, the reducing agent is flavodoxin, and no further catalyst is needed (the flavodoxin is kept in the reduced state by NADPH and |FRAME: EC-1.18.1.2|).
/
/A histidine residue embedded in the canonical B<sub>12</sub>-binding DxHxxG motif in methionine synthase serves as the lower axial ligand to the cobalt, which is bound in the "base-off/His-on" state |CITS: [7992050]|.

COMMENT - CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) are DNA sequences found in the genomes of prokaryotes that are derived from DNA fragments of bacteriophages that had previously infected the organism. They are used to detect and destroy DNA from similar bacteriophages during subsequent infections. CRISPR sequences are found in approximately 50% of sequenced bacterial genomes and nearly 90% of sequenced archaea |CITS: [29522745]|.
/
/CRISPR sequences are utilized by CRISPR-associated systems (Cas). A complex of Cas proteins (called Cascade) cuts the |FRAME: Pre-crRNAs "CRISPR RNA precursor"| within the repeats into mature RNA molecules called |FRAME: crRNAs CRISPR RNA"| (crRNA), which remains bound to the Cascade complex. Other Cas proteins are DNA or RNA nucleases. The complex guides tthose enzymes to its target (bacteriophage necleic acid), which is then cleaved |CITS: [22745249]|.
/
/By manipulating the nucleotide sequence of the guide RNA, an artificial Cas9 system can be programmed to target any DNA sequence for cleavage, making CRISPR a powerful tool for <i>in vivo</i> genetic engineering |CITS: [24136345][27401123]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Cyanocobamides
TYPES - Cobamides
TYPES - Nitriles
COMMON-NAME - a cyanocobamide
COMMENT - |FRAME: Cobamides "A cobamide"| is a corrinoid molecule based on the structure of |FRAME: CPD-20843|, a cobalt-corrinoid hexaamide that is formed from |FRAME: COBINAMIDE| by the attachment of an &alpha;-D-ribofuranose 3-phosphate residue at the 2 position of the aminopropanol chain.
/
/Biologically active forms of cobamides contain an upper (&beta;) and a lower (&alpha;) axial ligands. The most common upper axial ligand are either a methyl group or a 5'-deoxyadenosyl group, although some other forms exist. More variability is found with the lower axial ligand, where more that 16 different forms have been described.
/
/Some procedure for cobamide purification involve the replacement of the upper ligand with a cyano group. A common example is |FRAME:CPD-315|, also known as vitamin B12. Cyanocobamides do not occur in living organisms, and are only produced artificially.
/
/This class includes all cobamides that have a cyano group as their upper axial ligand.

COMMENT - Sialic acids are an important family of related 9-carbon sugars acids, present on the surface of many different cells and functioning in a wide range of different biological processes.
/
/<i>N</i>-acetylneuraminate, the most ubiquitous species amongst the sialic acids, is widely distributed in the
/animal kingdom as a component of oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, and glycolipids.
/<i>N</i>-acetylneuraminate carries out various biological functions by acting as receptors for
/microorganisms, viruses, toxins, and hormones, by masking receptors, and by regulation of the immune
/system.
/
/N-acetylneuraminic acid is the predominant form of sialic acid present in humans. It can be found as a terminal sugar on a wide range of surface glycoconjugates |CITS: [11841250]|. The &alpha;-anomer is the form that is found when sialic acid is bound to glycans, but in solution it exists mainly (over 90%) in the &beta;-anomeric form |CITS: [18063573]|. 
/
/A number of bacteria that can colonize humans make use of N-acetylneuraminic acid as a nutrient source. In addition, some pathogens such as |FRAME: TAX-727| use sialic acid in an immune evasion mechanism by adding N-acetylneuraminic acid to their lipopolysaccharide |CITS: [12180977][10447878]|, which provides increased survival in human serum. Most of these organisms are not capable of synthesizing N-acetylneuraminic acid and import it into the cells |CITS: [16262798]| after conversion (either spontaneous or enzymatic) to the &beta;-anomer |CITS: [18063573]| .

COMMENT - Monosaccharides are polyhydroxy aldehydes or polyhydroxy ketones with three or more carbon atoms. The generic term monosaccharide denotes a single unit, without glycosidic connection to other such units. Monosaccharides with an aldehydic carbonyl group are called aldoses, while those with a ketonic carbonyl carbonyl group are called ketoses.
/
/In addition to aldoses and ketose, the term 'monosaccharide' also includes additional forms, such as dialdoses, alduloses, and diketoses, as well as deoxy and amino monosaccharides, and their derivatives, provided that the parent compound has a (potential) carbonyl group.

TYPES - Macrocycles
COMMON-NAME - a porphyrin
COMMENT - A porphyrin is a heterocyclic macrocycle derived from porphine, a molecule that consists of four pyrrole
/rings joined together by four methine (=CH-) groups to form a larger macrocycle ring.
/Substituted porphines are called porphyrins. Many porphyrins occur in nature, and fulfil important
/biochemical roles. 
/Porphyrins can bind metals to form complexes. The metal ion, usually with a charge of 2+ or 3+,
/resides in the central cavity formed by the loss of two protons. Many metals are found with different
/derivatives, including Fe, Mg, Ni, Co and Zn.
/The name porphyrin comes from a Greek word for purple, since most porphyrins are red to purple
/in color. More reduced porphyrins, such as corphins, are yellowish.

UNIQUE-ID - Polyisoprenoids
TYPES - Lipids
COMMON-NAME - an isoprenoid
COMMENT - The nomenclature of isoprenoids and their derivatives is somewhat confusing. Here are some guidelines for understanding these names:
/
/Isoprenoids are composed of repeating isoprene units. The units can be attached in either a <i>trans</i> conformation (the two carbons are on opposite sides of the double bond) or a <i>cis</i> conformation (the two carbons are on the same side of the double bond). It is common to use <i>E</i> and <i>Z</i> instead of <i>trans</i> and <i>cis</i> , respectively.
/
/The numbering of carbons in the molecule starts from the carbon attached to the hydroxyl or phosphate group. The isoprene unit furthest from the C1 carbon is called the &omega; unit. Unlike all other isoprene units, the &omega; unit is not a stereo center since the last carbon is attached to two identical methyl groups.
/
/There are two widely used naming systems, and unfortunately they refer to the isoprene units in opposite order.
/One method describes the molecule starting with the unit with the lowest carbon number (ie the one furthest from the &omega; unit), naming each of the stereo-active carbons by its number, followed by its stereo designation. For example, |FRAME:CPD-11977 "this molecule"| is referred to as 2,6-<i>cis</i>,10-<i>trans</i>-tetraprenyl diphosphate or (2<i>Z</i>,6<i>Z</i>,10<i>E</i>)-tetraprenyl diphosphate.
/According to the other method, the molecule is described by the stereoconfiguration of the molecule starting with the &omega; unit. For example |FRAME:CPD-11977| is referred to as &omega;,<i>E,Z,Z</i> tetraprenyl diphosphate. 
/
/On top of this, many of the shorter molecules have trivial names that are commonly used. Some of these names are specific for a particular stereoisomer and some are used for all stereoisomer. For example, |FRAME: GERANYLGERANYL-PP "geranylgeranyl diphosphate"| is commonly used for the all-<i>trans</i> isomer of the molecule with four isoprene units, while farnesyl diphosphate is used for all four isomers of the molecule with three isoprene units - |FRAME:FARNESYL-PP|, |FRAME:CPD-9444|, |FRAME:CPD-11293| and |FRAME:CPD-11990|.

SYNONYMS - a deacetyl-citrate-lyase
SYNONYMS - a citrate lyase, inactive
SYNONYMS - a [citrate (pro-3S)-lyase]
COMMENT - Citrate lyase, an anaerobic enzyme, catalyzes the cleavage of citrate to acetate and oxaloacetate
/|CITS: [6354265]|. The citrate molecule is very stable, and needs to be activated prior to cleavage by
/forming a thioester bond with the enzyme.
/
/The enzyme is a complex of three subunits (in a 6:6:6 configuration), one of them a dedicated acyl carrier protein (acp).
/It is synthesized in an apo form, and is converted to its holo form by the covalent binding of the unusual prosthetic group |FRAME: 2-5-PHOSPHORIBOSYL-3-DEPHOSPHO-COA| to the [acp] component, resulting in |FRAME: HOLO-CITRATE-LYASE|. However, this holo form is still not fully active - in order to be active, the prosthetic group needs to be acetylated, a reaction catalyzed by the |FRAME: G6344|-encoded |FRAME: CITC-MONOMER|, which generates |FRAME: CITRATE-LYASE|.
/
/The &alpha; subunit of the |FRAME: ACECITLY-CPLX| is a citrate-[acp] transferase that catalyzes the exchange of the bound acetyl group with a citrate molecule, generating |FRAME: Citrate-Lyase-Citryl-Form| and releasing an |FRAME: ACET| molecule.
/The &beta; subunit, which is a citryl-[acp] lyase, catalyzes the subsequent step, cleaving the bound citryl group, releasing |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID| and regenerating |FRAME: CITRATE-LYASE|. Since the active form is regenrated, the enzyme can continuously catalyze the cleavage reaction.

COMMENT - Cytochrome <i>c</i> biogenesis in archaea and most Gram-negative bacteria occurs via a complicated pathway known as "system I". Most of the proteins involved in this pathway are encoded by the <i>ccmABCDEFGH</i> genes.
/
/|FRAME: CcmE-Proteins CcmE| is periplasmic heme chaperone |CITS: [9712585][9770295]| that forms a trimeric complex with the |FRAME: CcmD-Proteins CcmD| small membrane protein and the |FRAME: CcmC-Proteins CcmC| heme-binding membrane protein. CcmC contains six transmembrane domains and a large periplasmic domain that contains a WWD motif that binds heme. In addition, CcmC has two histidines flanking the WWD motif that serve as axial ligands to the heme.
/
/Once heme is bound to the WWD motif of CcmC, a spontaneous covalent bond forms between the 2-vinyl group of the heme and a histidine residue of CcmE |CITS: [15465823][15771504][16373344]|. Concomitantly the heme's iron is oxidized to the (III) valency |CITS: [19629033]|. While being covalently bound to CcmE, the heme is still bound non-covalently to CcmC..
/
/The heme-bound CcmE is released from the complex upon the binding of the |FRAME: CcmAB-Complex "CcmAB complex"|, leaving a |FRAME: CcmABCD-Complex "CcmABCD complex"| |CITS: [16824107]|.

UNIQUE-ID - apo-malonate-decarboxylases
TYPES - Protein-Complexes
COMMON-NAME - [an <i>apo</i> malonate decarboxylase acyl-carrier protein]
COMMENT - Several strains of bacteria are able to utilize malonate as sole source of carbon and energy. The key reaction in the pathway is the decarboxylation of malonate to acetate, which is catalyzed by malonate decarboxylase. Malonate is a rather inert compound, and its decarboxylation under physiological conditions requires an activation step, in which malonate forms a thioester derivative.
/
/Malonate decarboxylase is an enzyme complex composed of three subunits, one of which is a dedicated acyl-carrier protein (acp). The acp protein is synthesized in an <i>apo</i> form, and is converted to its <i>holo</i> form by the covalent binding of the prosthetic group |FRAME: 2-5-PHOSPHORIBOSYL-3-DEPHOSPHO-COA| to a serine residue. This prosthetic group is very unusual and the only other enzyme known to use it is |FRAME: ACECITLY-CPLX| (see |FRAME: P2-PWY|).

/The convention adopted here is to write the half reactions always in
/the same direction, namely in the form:
/
/Ox. + e- --> Red.
/
/In other words, the oxidized species and the electrons are always in
/the LEFT slot, and the reduced species are always in the RIGHT slot.
/
/This reaction direction allows the standard reduction potential to be
/directly recorded in the STD-REDUCTION-POTENTIAL slot, such that
/reactions of this type are comparable with each other.

UNIQUE-ID - Pre-crRNAs
TYPES - RNAs
COMMON-NAME - pre-crRNA
SYNONYMS - CRISPR RNA precursor
COMMENT - CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) are DNA sequences found in the genomes of prokaryotes that are derived from DNA fragments of bacteriophages that had previously infected the organism. They are used to detect and destroy DNA from similar bacteriophages during subsequent infections. CRISPR sequences are found in approximately 50% of sequenced bacterial genomes and nearly 90% of sequenced archaea |CITS: [29522745]|.
/
/CRISPR sequences are utilized by CRISPR-associated systems (Cas). A complex of Cas proteins (called Cascade) cuts the |FRAME: Pre-crRNAs "CRISPR RNA precursor"| within the repeats into mature RNA molecules called |FRAME: crRNAs CRISPR RNA"| (crRNA), which remains bound to the Cascade complex. Other Cas proteins are DNA or RNA nucleases. The complex guides tthose enzymes to its target (bacteriophage necleic acid), which is then cleaved |CITS: [22745249]|.
/
/By manipulating the nucleotide sequence of the guide RNA, an artificial Cas9 system can be programmed to target any DNA sequence for cleavage, making CRISPR a powerful tool for <i>in vivo</i> genetic engineering |CITS: [24136345][27401123]|.
/
/Some Cas systems, such as Cas-9, require an additional small RNA, known as <i>trans</i>-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA) for activity |CITS: [21455174]|. Other systems, such as Cas-12a, do not require tracrRNA |CITS: [28646112]|. Some systems, such as Cas9 and Cas13a, are DNA-specific, while other systems, such as Cas13, target single-stranded RNA |CITS: [27256883]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Cofactors
TYPES - Biological-Roles
COMMON-NAME - an enzyme cofactor
SYNONYMS - a prosthetic group
SYNONYMS - a coenzyme
SYNONYMS - a cofactor
COMMENT - An enzyme cofactor is a non-protein chemical compound that is required by an enzyme for catalysis of a chemical reaction. Cofactors associate with inactive <i>apo</i>-enzymes, resulting in formation of active <i>holo</i>-enzymes.
/Unlike cosubstrates, the cofactors are restored to their original state at the end of the catalytic cycle and are thus not included in the reaction equation.
/
/Cofactors can be inorganic ions (e.g. Ca<sup>2+</sup>), inorganic molecules (e.g. |FRAME: FeS-Centers|) or organic molecules (e.g. |FRAME: PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE|). Some compounds may act as cofactors for a particular enzyme and a cosubstrate for a different enzyme, depending on whether they are restored to their active state at the end of the reaction. 
/Cofactors that are tightly bound to an enzyme have often been referred to as prosthetic groups. It should be noted that the degree of tightness required for this definition has not been defined, and that the same cofactor may bind differently to different enzymes, making this term imprecise. Thus, it is recommended not to use it. Organic cofactors that are loosely bound to the enzyme have been often referred to as coenzymes. However, that term is also imprecise, and it is recommended not to use it either.

TYPES - Alcohols
COMMON-NAME - a fatty alcohol
COMMENT - Fatty alcohols are aliphatic |FRAME: Alcohols alcohols| consisting of a chain of 3 or more carbon atoms. They may be saturated or unsaturated and may be branched or unbranched.
/
/Many enzymes that act on |FRAME: Fatty-Acids "fatty acids"|, as well as the corresponding |FRAME: Fatty-Acyl-CoAs "fatty acyl-CoAs"|, |FRAME: Fatty-Alcohols alcohols|, and |FRAME: Fatty-Aldehydes aldehydes|, have evolved to recognize substrates with a limited range of chain lengths.

//
UNIQUE-ID - HypA
TYPES - Polypeptides
COMMON-NAME - a HypA hydrogenase accessory protein
COMMENT - The |FRAME: HypA HypA| and |FRAME: HypB HypB| proteins, with participation of the SlyD protein, insert the Ni ion into the large subunit of [NiFe]-hydrogenases. In |FRAME: TAX-562|, which possesses three different [NiFe]-hydrogenases, HypA is hydrogenase specific, and interacts only with hydrogenase 3. Its function is provided by HybF in the case of hydrogenases 1 and 2.
/
/HypA is a Ni-metallochaperone that consists of a Ni-binding domain and a Zn-binding domain |CITS: [19621959][19769985]|. The Ni binding domain contains a highly conserved MHE motif that is essential for Ni binding at the N terminus. On it's own HypA binds to a Ni ion with micromolar affinity. However, following the formation of a complex with HypB the affinity increases to 7 nM |CITS: [26056269]|. 
/
/HypB characterized from most bacterial species consists of a common GTPase domain and a less conserved metal-binding region |CITS: [16807243][22276211][24338018]|. Both domains have a Ni-binding site, with the site located in the GTPase domain having a much lower affinity. In |FRAME: TAX-562| the nickel ion in the high affinity site is ligated with sub-picomolar affinity in a square planar geometry by a CTTCGCG motif through three cysteine thiolate ligands and the N-terminal amine |CITS: [28352890]|. An archaeal ortholog was shown to possess ATPase rather than GTPase activity, and to lack the high affinity nickel-binding site |CITS: [23399544]|.
/
/HypA and HypB form a transient complex in the Ni insertion process |CITS: [22384275][22179820]|. In organisms that have a GTPase-type HypB like |FRAME: TAX-562| Ni transfer occurs from HypB to HypA, which serves as a dock for the hydrogenase large subunit |CITS: [22016389]|. In organisms that contain an ATPase-type HypB, Ni is bound directly to HypA, but interaction with HypB results in its release and transfer to the hydrogenase large subunit |CITS: [32227866]|.

UNIQUE-ID - AEROBIC-RESPIRATION
TYPES - Respiration
COMMON-NAME - Aerobic Respiration
COMMENT - Like |FRAME: Fermentation fermentation|, respiration is a process by which
/electrons are passed from an electron donor to a terminal electron acceptor.
/However, in respiration the electrons do not pass directly from the donor to the
/acceptor. Instead, they pass a number of membrane-bound electron carriers that
/function as a transport chain, passing the electrons from one to another in steps
/that follow the electrochemical gradients between the electron donor and the
/acceptor.
/
/Each oxidized member of the electron transfer chain (which can be
/|FRAME: Flavoproteins|, |FRAME: ETR-Quinones|, |FRAME: Cytochromes|, or other
/type of electron carrier) can be reduced by the reduced form of the preceding
/member, and the electrons flow through the chain all the way to the terminal
/acceptor, which could be |FRAME: OXYGEN-MOLECULE| in the case of
/|FRAME: AEROBIC-RESPIRATION "aerobic respiration"|, or another type of molecule in
/|FRAME: ANAEROBIC-RESPIRATION "anaerobic respiration"|.
/
/Known terminal acceptors involved in anaerobic respiration include organic
/compounds (|FRAME: FUM|, |FRAME: DMSO|, or |FRAME: TRIMETHYLAMINE-N-O|),
/or inorganic compounds (|FRAME: NITRATE|, |FRAME: NITRITE|,
/|FRAME: NITROUS-OXIDE|, |FRAME: CHLORATE|, |FRAME: CPD0-1385|,
/|FRAME: MN+3 "oxidized manganese ions"|, |FRAME: FE+3 "ferric iron"|, gold,
/|FRAME: SELENATE|, |FRAME: ARSENATE|, |FRAME: SULFATE| and
/|FRAME: Elemental-Sulfur "elemental sulfur"|).
/
/During the process of electron transfer, a proton gradient is formed across the
/membrane due to three potential processes
/
/1. The use of some of the energy associated with the electron transfer for active
/pumping of protons across a membrane.
/
/2. Exporting protons out of the cell during electron-to-hydrogen transfers.
/
/3. Scalar reactions that consume protons on one side of a membrane, or produce them
/on the other side of the membrane, without actually moving a proton from one
/compartment to another.
/
/Upon passage of protons back into the cytoplasm, they drive multisubunit
/|FRAME: EC-7.1.2.2 "ATP synthase"| enzymes that generate ATP.
/
/This class, which stands for aerobic respiration, contains pathways through
/which electrons flow from various organic and inorganic electron donors to
/oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor.

COMMON-NAME - a HypC/HypD [NiFe]-hydrogenase maturation proteins dimer
COMMENT - The HypC protein is an accessory protein involved in the maturation of the |FRAME: CPD-24862| of |FRAME: NiFe-hydrogenases "[NiFe]-hydrogenases"| |CITS: [1482271]|. The process starts with attachement of an Fe-CO<sub>2</sub> moiety to a dimeric form of the |FRAME: HypC "HypC accessory chaperone"| |CITS: [23851071]|. HypC then forms a heterodimer with |FRAME: HypD HypD| (releasing a HypC monomer), followed by reduction of the CO<sub>2</sub> to CO |CITS: [23851071]|. Further interactions with the accessory proteins HypE and HypF result in conversion of the attached group to Fe(CO)(CN)<sub>2</sub>. This partial cofactor is then transferred to the HycE subunit (large subunit) of the hydrogenase, followed by nickel insertion and final processing |CITS: [34409988]|.

COMMENT - A semiquinone is a free radical resulting from the removal of one hydrogen atom with its electron during the process of dehydrogenation of |FRAME: Reduced-Quinones| to |FRAME: Quinones| or, alternatively, the addition of a single hydrogen atom to |FRAME: Quinones|.
/
/Quinones are organic compounds derived from aromatic compounds, with two carbonyl groups incorporated into the ring structure with rearrangement of the double bonds where necessary. Quinones are conjugated but not aromatic.
/
/A classic example of a quinone is |FRAME: P-BENZOQUINONE|. Quinones are commonly named with a prefix that indicates the parent aromatic hydrocarbon (for example, "benzo-" for benzene, "naphtho-" for naphthalene, and "anthra-" for anthracene) with a "-quinone" suffix.
/
/Several types of quinones serve as electron acceptors in electron transport chains. Quinones can carry two electrons, and when fully reduced they are referred to as |FRAME: Reduced-Quinones quinols|. The addition of a single H atom to a quinone results in formation of a free radical called |FRAME: Semiquinones|.
/
/Many quinone derivatives often have other biological activities, such as |FRAME: CPD-11501 "vitamin K"|.

/at C-10 and C-13. An alkyl side chain may also be present at C-17.
/
/Steroids are abundant in the environment. Large amounts of steroids and their derivatives are synthesized by eukaryotes, and these molecules play very important and diverse roles and include hormones, detergents that facilitate the absorption of lipids by the intestine, and membrane constituents. Some of them, |FRAME: CHOLESTEROL| and related compounds, are ubiquitous as membrane constituent of eukaryotes (for instance, up to 10% of the dry mass of yeast is |FRAME: ERGOSTEROL|) and as the precursors of all steroid hormones, vitamin D, and the bile acids.
/
/Interestingly, with exception of methane-oxidizing bacteria that contain relatively large amounts of sterols, sterols are absent from most prokaryotes. However, many bacterial membranes contain |FRAME: Hopanoids hopanoids|, which are similar pentacyclic sterol-like molecules |CITS: [18039763]|.

SYNONYMS - a transfer RNA
COMMENT - A transfer RNA (tRNA) is is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group of the aminoacyl-adenylate to the 2' or 3' terminal OH of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes).

While some sRNAs are encoded antisense to their target RNA, most sRNAs are transcribed at other locations on the genome (<i>trans</i>-encoded) and act by base-pairing with RNA targets despite of limited complementarity. The outcome of this base-pairing can vary, but ultimately leads to some regulatory effect on the target RNA |CITS: [32147527]|.
/

/
/|FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP| are dinucleotides containing one |FRAME: NIACINAMIDE| base and one |FRAME: ADENINE| base. Each nucleotide is connected to a ribose sugar at position 1, and the two riboses are connected at their 5 position via a diphosphate. The only difference between the two is that in NADP there is an additional phosphate group at the 2' position of the ribose that carries the adenine moiety.
/
/These molecules are biological carriers of reductive equivalents (i.e. high potential electrons). They are often referred to as coenzymes, although in most of their reactions they function as cosubstrates rather than true coenzymes.
/
/The most common function of |FRAME: NAD| is to accept two electrons and a proton (a hydride ion) from a substrate that is being oxidized. This reduction converts |FRAME: NAD| to |FRAME: NADH|, the reduced form. NADH then diffuses or is transported to a terminal oxidase, where the electrons are passed on, regenerating the oxidized form.

This reduction converts |FRAME: NAD| to |FRAME: NADH|, the reduced form. NADH then diffuses or is transported to a terminal oxidase, where the electrons are passed on, regenerating the oxidized form.
/
/|FRAME: NADPH|, on the other hand, is mostly involved in biosynthetic reactions, where it serves as an electron donor. NADPH is formed by reduction of |FRAME: NADP|, which occurs by different mechanisms in different types of organisms. In photosynthetic organisms |FRAME: NADP| is reduced by |FRAME: CPLX-84|. In heterotrophic organisms it is reduced by central metabolism processes such as the pentose phosphate pathway (see |FRAME: OXIDATIVEPENT-PWY|).

/
/Quinones are organic compounds derived from aromatic compounds, with two carbonyl groups incorporated into the ring structure with rearrangement of the double bonds where necessary. Quinones are conjugated but not aromatic.
/
/A classic example of a quinone is |FRAME: P-BENZOQUINONE|. Quinones are commonly named with a prefix that indicates the parent aromatic hydrocarbon (for example, "benzo-" for benzene, "naphtho-" for naphthalene, and "anthra-" for anthracene) with a "-quinone" suffix.
/
/Several types of quinones serve as electron acceptors in electron transport chains. Quinones can carry two electrons, and when fully reduced they are referred to as |FRAME: Reduced-Quinones quinols|. The addition of a single H atom to a quinone results in formation of a free radical called |FRAME: Semiquinones|.

TYPES - Reduced-Flavoproteins
COMMON-NAME - a reduced electron-transfer flavoprotein
SYNONYMS - ETFH<sub>2</sub>
SYNONYMS - a reduced ETF
SYNONYMS - a reduced electron-transferring flavoprotein
COMMENT - The electron transferring-flavoproteins (ETF) serve as specific electron carriers for other dehydrogenases.
/
/Most of the characterized electron-transferring flavoproteins belong to a single group (the canonical ETFs). These proteins, including those from mammals |CITS: [8962055]|, plants |CITS: [16923016]|, and some bacteria, such as the methylotrophic bacterium |FRAME: TAX-2327| |CITS: [7798207]| and the soil bacterium |FRAME: TAX-266| |CITS: [10026281]|, are heterodimeric, contain one non-covalently bound FAD and one AMP per molecule, and function as electron carriers between diverse flavoproteins (such as |FRAME: ACYLCOADEHYDROG-MONOMER "acyl-CoA dehydrogenases"|, |FRAME: CPLX-6421|, and |FRAME: CPLX-7462|) and the quinone pool. They transfer the electrons to the main respiratory chain via |FRAME: EC-1.5.5.1| (ETF dehydrogenase).
/
/A different type of ETF possess electron transfer bifurcating activity: ability to accept a pair of electrons from NADH and use one to generate a strong reductant such as flavodoxin hydroquinone or reduced ferredoxin. This endergonic electron transfer is paid for by exergonic transfer of the other electron to a strong electron acceptor via a corresponding partner enzyme, such as a quinone reductase in the case of ETFs associated with nitrogen fixation, or |FRAME: CPLX-7036| (BCD) in the case of some butanoate-producing anaerobic bacteria |CITS: [14688238]|.
/
/The bifurcating ETFs are also heterodimeric, but contain two FAD molecules (the presence of AMP has not been reported). The hydride group from NADH is transferred to the first FAD (the so-called bifurcating FAD or Bf-FAD), which passes one electron exergonically to the second FAD. By passing only a single electron the Bf-FAD assumes a reactive semiquinone state able to reduce ferredoxin or flavodoxin semiquinone. The second FAD (the electron transfer FAD, or ET-FAD), which correspond to the single FAD present in canonical ETFs, passes the electron it received to the second acceptor via exergonic electron transfer |CITS: [31588324]|. The two-flavin ETFs form a complex with the enzymes they interact with.

COMMON-NAME - a catecholate siderophore
COMMENT - Siderophores are small, high-affinity iron chelating compounds usually produced and secreted by microorganisms. Once outside the cell, siderophores bind |FRAME: FE+3| with high affinity, and the iron-siderophore complexes are imported back into the cell by active-transport mechanisms.
/
/Siderophores are very common in pathogenic bacteria, since iron in the host organism is usually tightly bound to proteins, resulting in an extremely low concentration of free iron in the blood.
/
/Most siderophores belong to one of three major groups: the |FRAME: Catecholate-siderophores "catechols"|, |FRAME: Hydroxamate-siderophores "hydroxamates"| and |FRAME: Thiazoline-siderophores "thiazolines"|. 
/Some grasses are known to make siderophores as well. These |FRAME: Phytosiderophores "phytosiderophores"| are also known as mugineic acids.

UNIQUE-ID - Redox-Electron-Carriers
TYPES - Acceptors
COMMON-NAME - a redox electron carrier
COMMENT - In general, an electron carrier is a chemical entity that can accept or donate electrons from/to another chemical entity.
/When accepting electrons, it acts as an "electron acceptor". By accepting the electrons, the acceptor is reduced, and thus prior to receiving the electrons the entity is called  "an oxidized electron acceptor" and after receiving them it is called "a reduced electron acceptor".
/
/Many reduced electron acceptors are able to transfer the electrons to other molecules, becoming oxidized in the process. Thus the distinction between an electron acceptor and an electron donor is often not determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some acceptors in biological reactions only accept electrons and do not transfer them further. Those are often known as "terminal electron acceptors".
/
/While in general every chemical reaction in which electrons are transferred includes an electron donor and an electron acceptor, several molecules are commonly used in metabolism solely for the purpose of electron transfer, and are referred to in biology as electron carriers. Different biological electron carriers differ in the number of electrons that they transfer and in their electron affinity.
/
/Some of the common biological electron carriers transfer only a single electron (e.g. |FRAME: Cytochromes cytochromes|, |FRAME: Blue-Copper-Proteins "blue copper proteins"|, and some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer two electrons (e.g. some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer a hydride ion ( e.g. |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP|), and some transfer two electrons and two protons (|FRAME: ETR-Quinones quinones|, |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|).
/In addition, a number of inorganic small molecules (e.g. oxygen, nitrate, iron (III), manganese (IV), sulfate) are often used as terminal electron acceptors.

COMMON-NAME - a lipopolysaccharide
SYNONYMS - LPS
COMMENT - This compound class stands for generic and unspecified lipopolysaccharides. The structure shown here is intended to provide a general overview and does not describe a lipopolysaccharide from a specific species.
/
/Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are a major component of the outer membrane of almost all Gram-negative bacteria. While they are protecting the membrane from certain kinds of chemical attacks, they also induce a strong response from animal immune systems. 
/
/Lipopolysaccharides can be conceptually divided into three parts: |FRAME: Lipid-A "lipid A"|, which anchors LPS into the membrane; the |FRAME: LPS-Core-Oligosaccharides "core oligosaccharide"|, which contributes to membrane stability; and the |FRAME: O-Antigens O-antigen|, which is a polysaccharide that extends away from the cell surface.
/
/Lipopolysaccharides that comprise all three regions are called |FRAME: Smooth-Form-LPS "smooth (S)-form LPS"|, while LPS lacking the <i>O</i>-antigen are named |FRAME: LOS "rough (R)-form LPS"| or lipooligosaccharide (LOS).
/
/Lipid A, which is common to most Gram negative bacteria, is the most toxic part. The core polysaccharide is genus specific, and contains unusual 7-carbon and 8-carbon sugars, and the <i>O</i>-antigen's side chains are variable in structure and toxicity.
/
/The <i>O</i>-antigen usually consists of about 20-40 repeated subunits.

COMMON-NAME - a mannosylerythritol lipid
COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD-25639 "Mannosylerythritol lipids"| (MELs) are amphiphilic glycolipids that display high surface activity and act as biodetergents (biosurfactants). The compounds are produced by yeast strains that belong to the |FRAME: TAX-5269| and |FRAME: TAX-63261| genera. They show excellent surface-active properties and versatile biochemical actions. The compounds were first described in 1956 from an |FRAME: TAX-5269| species |CITS: [13276861]|. However, the most common MEL producing species are members of the |FRAME: TAX-63261| genus, such as |FRAME: TAX-84753|, |FRAME: TAX-84754|, |FRAME: TAX-84752|, and |FRAME: TAX-203536| |CITS: [25723622]|.
/
/The lipids are acylated at positions O-2' and O-3' by a range of fatty acyl residues. In |FRAME: TAX-5270| the fatty acid at O-2' ranges from C2 to C6, while that at O-3' ranges from C12 to C16. In addition, MELs differ in their acetylation status. Four general types are produced differing in the acetylation of positions O-4' and O-6'. Mel-D has no acetylation, MEL-B is acetylated only at the O-6' position, MEL-C is acetylated only at the O-4' position, and MEL-A is acetylated at both positions |CITS: [Kitamoto90a][Kitamoto90][10570818][17898510]|. 
/
/The biological function of MELs is still unknown, but they are of growing biotechnological interest as a sustainable alternative for chemical surfactants |CITS: [18585066][22901730]|.

COMMON-NAME - Composite Reactions
COMMENT - A composite reaction R is represented both as a net chemical
/transformation, and a set of sub-reactions of which R is comprised.
/Those sub-reactions represent finer grained details of the reaction.
/Thus, composite reactions may have their mechanistic details recorded,
/when such information is available.  The relationships among the
/sub-reactions are stored in the same way as are the relationships of
/reactions within a pathway (i.e. using the Reaction-List/In-Pathway and 
/Predecessors slots).  As a result, composite reactions exhibit
/hybrid properties: internally, they are constructed like pathways, and
/externally, they look like reactions.
/
/The LEFT and RIGHT slots of composite reactions reflect the overall
/inputs and outputs of the composite transformation.  At a later point
/in time, these slots should be automatically kept in synch with the
/sub-reactions.  However, currently the Reaction Editor will have the
/burden of updating the LEFT and RIGHT slots.
/
/An enzyme that is linked to a composite reaction may or may not also
/be linked to its sub-reactions -- cases when we might not want to link
/the enzyme to sub-reactions might be if one or more sub-reactions are
/spontaneous (so the enzyme would only be linked to the non-spontaneous
/sub-reactions), or if the enzyme were a complex with each of its subunits
/catalyzing a different sub-reaction (in which case it should be the subunit
/that is linked to each corresponding sub-reaction, not the complex).

UNIQUE-ID - Hydride-Acceptors
TYPES - Redox-Electron-Carriers
COMMON-NAME - an unknown electron carrier
SYNONYMS - an unknown electron donor
SYNONYMS - an unknown electron acceptor
COMMENT - In general, an electron carrier is a chemical entity that can accept or donate electrons from/to another chemical entity.
/When accepting electrons, it acts as an "electron acceptor". By accepting the electrons, the acceptor is reduced, and thus prior to receiving the electrons the entity is called  "an oxidized electron acceptor" and after receiving them it is called "a reduced electron acceptor".
/
/Many reduced electron acceptors are able to transfer the electrons to other molecules, becoming oxidized in the process. Thus the distinction between an electron acceptor and an electron donor is often not determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some acceptors in biological reactions only accept electrons and do not transfer them further. Those are often known as "terminal electron acceptors".
/
/While in general every chemical reaction in which electrons are transferred includes an electron donor and an electron acceptor, several molecules are commonly used in metabolism solely for the purpose of electron transfer, and are referred to in biology as electron carriers. Different biological electron carriers differ in the number of electrons that they transfer and in their electron affinity.
/
/Some of the common biological electron carriers transfer only a single electron (e.g. |FRAME: Cytochromes cytochromes|, |FRAME: Blue-Copper-Proteins "blue copper proteins"|, and some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer two electrons (e.g. some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer a hydride ion ( e.g. |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP|), and some transfer two electrons and two protons (|FRAME: ETR-Quinones quinones|, |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|).
/In addition, a number of inorganic small molecules (e.g. oxygen, nitrate, iron (III), manganese (IV), sulfate) are often used as terminal electron acceptors.
/
/In many cases, purified enzymes can act <i>in vitro</i> using an artificial electron carrier, and their <i>in vivo</i> electron carrier is not known. This class of "unknown electron carriers" is used to describe such reactions, which are incompletely characterized.

COMMON-NAME - a reduced ferredoxin [iron-sulfur] cluster
SYNONYMS - a reduced ferredoxin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Ferredoxins Ferredoxins| are present in all organisms, from bacteria and archaea to higher eukaryotes.
/They are small and acidic proteins with prosthetic groups composed of iron and sulfur atoms, which are referred to as |FRAME: FeS-Centers "iron-sulfur clusters"|. The ferredoxins function as intracellular electron carriers with a low reduction potential, and do not carry out classical enzyme functions. Ferredoxins characteristically transfer an electron
/with a reduction potential E0' near -420mV (though the reduction potential of ferredoxins from some anaerobic microorganisms can be as low as -500mV |CITS: [Li16]| and as high as -340mV |CITS: [12610725]|).
/
/Ferredoxins are classified into several groups according to the types and numbers of their Fe-S clusters. The |FRAME: 2Fe-2S-Ferredoxins "[2Fe-2S] ferredoxin"| group consists of monomeric proteins containing a single |FRAME: CPD-6|. This group includes ferredoxins that transfer electrons in redox chains linked to hydroxylases and oxygenases in a wide range of organisms (from bacteria to mammals), and which includes plant and algal ferredoxins that function as electron carriers in photosynthesis. A related group contains |FRAME: Rieske-Type-Ferredoxins|, where two of the cysteine groups are replaced by histidine residues.
/
/|FRAME: 4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| and |FRAME: 3Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "[3Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| are typically found in bacteria. They may differ in cluster type (3Fe or 4Fe), number of clusters (one or two), and length of polypeptide chain (up to over 100 residues), and include the relatively small dual cluster |FRAME: 2-4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| that were first isolated from anaerobic bacteria |CITS: [16466637]|.
/
/Even though each cluster contains more than one iron atom, each cluster can carry only one extra electron. Thus ferredoxins that contain a single cluster participate in single electron transfer reactions, while ferredoxins that carry two clusters can transfer two electrons simultaneously.
/
/The structure given for this entry is that of a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin, and is provided for illustration only.

SYNONYMS - capped mRNA with <i>cap2</i> structure
COMMENT - The messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of all metazoan organisms and most eukaryotic viruses possess a 5' cap structure consisting of a 7-methyl guanosine (m7G) linked via an inverted 5'5' triphosphate bridge to the initiating nucleoside
/of the transcript.  The inverted m7G, which is also known as a cap0 structure, marks transcription start sites, and has multiple effects on gene expression, including enhancement of RNA stability, splicing, nucleocytoplasmic transport and translation initiation, as facilitated by interactions with nuclear and cytoplasmic cap binding proteins.
/
/The initiating nucleoside of the transcript, and often the second transcribed nucleotide, are modified by 2'-O-ribose methylation. Methylation of the ribose on the first transcribed nucleotide is termed cap1 and similar methylation of the second transcribed position is termed cap2 |CITS: [21310715]|.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Electron-Transfer-Reactions
TYPES - Composite-Reactions
COMMENT - Electron transfer reactions (ETRs) describe reactions that transfer
/electrons between substrates, which are thus involved in redox
/processes that oxidize and reduce some of the substrates.  ETRs
/usually take place at membranes, because a key purpose of ETRs is to
/use the electron energy to build up a proton gradient across the
/membrane, which can then be used for energy generation by the cell,
/using ATP synthesis driven by the proton gradient.  ETRs very often
/involve the pool of membrane-bound quinone substrates, which can
/shuttle electrons to or from an ETR.
/
/All ETRs are composite reactions, because they involve at least two
/redox half reactions.  These half reactions involve explicit
/electrons, which cannot occur freely. Thus, the half reactions have to
/be paired up, with the result that the electrons are used only
/internally to connect the half reactions, and are not visible
/as substrates of the ETR.
/
/Sometimes, a proton transport reaction can also be a sub-reaction of
/the ETR, to represent so-called vectoral proton movement.  In the
/vectoral case, protons are actively pumped across the membrane, using
/energy extracted from the redox processes.  The proton transport
/reaction is not directly connected to the redox half reactions in the
/pathway representation of the composite reaction.
/
/Because ETRs tend to occur at membranes, substrates that are not in
/the default compartment (the cytoplasm) need to have compartment
/information associated by means of value annotations.  The exception
/to this are the membrane-bound quinone substrates, which are always
/assumed to reside in the membrane itself.

UNIQUE-ID - Peptidoglycans
TYPES - Glycoconjugates
COMMON-NAME - a peptidoglycan
COMMENT - The bacterial bag-shaped envelope (sacculus) can resist turgor pressures of 2-5 atmospheres in Gram-negative bacteria, and up to 20 atm in Gram-positive bacteria. This remarkable tensile strength, combined with elasticity, is achieved by the structure of the cell wall's main component, peptidoglycan (also known as "basal structure", "mucopeptide", "glycopeptide", "glycosaminopeptide" and "murein").
/
/Peptidoglycan is best described as a fisherman net. The net is made of parallel, rather inextensible glycan threads consisting of alternating |FRAME: N-ACETYL-BETA-D-GLUCOSAMINE| (GlcNAc) and |FRAME: CPD-19950| (MurNAc) sugars, which are held together by small elastic peptide crosslinks which are formed between the side-chains of the different strands, allowing the net to expand or shrink |CITS: [10532377]|.
/

Its structure is analogous to phosphatidylinositol (PI), but with a glyceryl moiety replacing the inosityl moiety of PI. 
/
/Within a decade it has been found in higher plants |CITS: [Benson61]|, Gram-negative bacteria |CITS: [4868364][4295332]| and mammals |CITS: [5660098]|. It was later discovered in the archaeon |FRAME: TAX-2246|, indicating that it is produced by all three domains of life.

SYNONYMS - L-alanyl-&gamma;-D-glutamyl-L-lysyl/meso-2,6-diaminoheptanedioyl-D-alanine
COMMENT - The peptide moiety of peptidoglycan, which is bound through its N terminus to the carboxyl group of muramate and contains L and D amino acids, reveals considerable variation. These peptides are synthesized as penetapeptides, but are often cleaved, resulting in a range in length of 2 to 5 amino acids. In addition, the peptide side-chain are often branched with additional amino acids. This compound class represnets the pentapeptide form.
/
/The amino acid linked directly to muramate is usually |FRAME:L-ALPHA-ALANINE|, but in some cases can be replaced by |FRAME: GLY| or |FRAME: SER| |CITS: [5777324][5965240][4385976][6029599][5704800][5469569][6033749]|.
/
/The most common amino acid in the second position is |FRAME: D-GLT|, but in some cases (in a few coryneform bacteria) it is hydroxylated to |FRAME: CPD-48| |CITS: [6072398]|. In some organisms the &alpha;-carboxyl group of |FRAME: D-GLT| is modified by amidation or substituted by |FRAME: GLY| |CITS: [5965232][6064598]|, by |FRAME: GLYCINAMIDE| |CITS: [Interschick70]|, or by |FRAME: CPD0-1578| |CITS: [4683671]|.
/
/The greatest variation occurs at position 3. The residue at this position is usually a diamino acid and is involved in cross-linking through the second amino group. The most common residue at this position is |FRAME: MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE|, which is present in probably all Gram-negative bacteria and in many other organisms, such as some species of bacilli, clostridia, lactobacilli, corynebacteria, propionibacteria, Actinomycetales, Myxobacteriales, Rickettsiae, and cyanobacteria |CITS: [410379][6131881]| (see |FRAME:PEPTIDOGLYCANSYN-PWY|).
/The second common residue at this position is |FRAME: LYS|, but other substituition have been documented, including |FRAME: L-ORNITHINE| |CITS: [4884715][14152785][6035494][6031807]|, |FRAME:LL-DIAMINOPIMELATE| |CITS: [14024243][13882624][13525638][11945321]|, |FRAME: CPD-7690| |CITS: [5870104]|, and |FRAME: 5-HYDROXY-L-LYSINE| |CITS: [16562051]|. In some cases the diamino acid in position 3 is not involved in cross linking. In these cases
/the residue in position 3 can be |FRAME: N-ACETYL-L-24-DIAMINOBUTANOATE|, as in the case of |FRAME: TAX-28447| |CITS: [5704800][5119774]|, or even a monoamino acid, such as |FRAME:L-ALPHA-ALANINE|, |FRAME: GLT| |CITS: [4259817]| or |FRAME: HOMO-SER| |CITS: [5119774][5119774 ][5469569]|.
/
/Position 4 and 5 are almost always occupied by |FRAME: D-ALA-D-ALA| di-peptide. In several species of enterococci and lactobacilli, the terminal |FRAME:D-ALANINE| is replaced by |FRAME:D-LACTATE| |CITS: [1503450]| or |FRAME:D-SERINE| |CITS: [8852545]|, which entails resistance to the glycopeptide antibiotic |FRAME: CPD-12245|.

UNIQUE-ID - Inositols
TYPES - Cyclitols
COMMON-NAME - an inositol
SYNONYMS - 1,2,3,4,5,6-cyclohexanehexol
COMMENT - |FRAME: Inositols Inositol| is the generic name for 1,2,3,4,5,6-cyclohexanehexol. Epimerization of the six hydroxyl groups results in nine stereoisomers. Among the isomers, |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| is the most abundant in nature and it is an essential compound in eukaryotic cell membranes as a phosphatidylinositol moiety, which plays an important role in signal transduction. Some other forms, such as |FRAME: CPD-8050|, are also found in nature, although they are less abundant.
/
/Nomenclature of cyclitols can be quite confusing. Two alternative naming schemes are possible for inositol compounds since carbon-1 could be assigned to either of two enantiotopic carbons. The two methods result in 1D-stereochemistry and 1L-stereochemistry based names. If carbon-1 is placed at the top of the molecule, L-numbering proceeds clockwise, while D-numbering proceeds counter-clockwise. Both the 1D or 1L designations can be employed currently. However, the symbol Ins implies myo-inositol with D- numbering.
/
/Additional information on the nomenclature of <i>myo</i>-inositol compounds can be found in the 1973 document <A href="http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1974/pdf/3701x0283.pdf">Nomenclature of cyclitols</A> by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry (NC-IUB), and the 1988 publication <A href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbcs/iupac/cyclitol/myo.html">Numbering of atoms in <i>myo</i>-inositol</A>, published by the same body, whose aim was to relax some of the rules specified in the 1973 publication.
/
/To aid in following the transformations in inositol compounds in pathways, the structures of inositol stereoisomers in MetaCyc have been formatted to show carbon 1 at the top of the ring, with numbering proceeding clockwise. An exception is the structure of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL|, which is presented with carbon 3 at the top and counter-clockwise numbering. The reason is that carbon 3 of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| (which is based on L-numbering) matches the carbon-1 of 1D numbering, which is used for the various phosphorylated and otherwise modified forms, and by presenting the molecule in this way, it is much easier to show structural relationships in reactions and pathways (see for example |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL-1-KINASE-RXN "EC 2.7.1.64"|).

COMMENT - Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are isoprenoid quinones of the naphthalene series, and are constituents of bacterial plasma membranes, where they play important roles in electron transfer and oxidative phosphorylation. Menaquinones are the most widespread respiratory quinones in biological systems |CITS: [Fujimoto12]|. Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are named MK-<i>n</i> or DMK-<i>n</i>, respectively, where the <i>n</i> refers to the number of prenyl units present in the side chain. The most common length of the side chain in bacteria is 8, although minor amounts of MK-1 through MK-14 have been found |CITS: [7022156]|.
/
/Many bacteria and archaea have |FRAME: Dihydromenaquinones "dehydrogenated menaquinones"|, which are named MK-<i>n</i>(H<sub>2</sub>). The degree and location of dehydrogenation depends on the species. Some organisms have menaquinones with modifications of the head group, for example |FRAME: TAX-2302| possess both |FRAME: CPD-15875 thermoplasmaquinones| (TPQ), which contains an extra methyl group, and |FRAME: CPD-15876 methionaquinones| (MTK), which contains a methylthio group |CITS: [11157962]|.
/
/Menaquinones are also known as vitamin K<sub>2</sub>. Vitamin K is a name given to a group of derivatives  of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone that are required by mammals for the posttranslational modification of certain proteins, mostly involved in blood coagulation. These compounds, while essential for mammals, are not synthesized by them, and are thus considered vitamins.
/
/The natural forms of the vitamin are vitamin K<sub>1</sub> (|FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE|) and vitamin K<sub>2</sub> (|FRAME: Menaquinones "menaquinone"|). Since menaquinones produced by different organisms have different tail lengths there are many variations of vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, usually specified based on the number of carbons in their tails, such as in Vitamin K<sub>2</sub>(45).
/
/The reduced form of menaquinone is called |FRAME: Menaquinols|.

UNIQUE-ID - Lipid-A
TYPES - Lipid-A-containing-Glycolipids
COMMON-NAME - a lipid A
COMMENT - Lipid A is a lipid component of the |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides "lipopolysaccharides"| (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria. Its hydrophobic nature allows it to anchor the LPS to the outer membrane.
/
/Lipid A consists of two glucosamine units attached by a &beta;(1&rarr;6) linkage and decorated with four to seven acyl chains and one or two phosphate groups. Up to four acyl chains, often with a &beta; hydroxy group and usually 10 to 18 carbons in length, are attached directly to the glucosamine sugars at positions N-2 and O-3 (and N'-2 and O'-3, respectively), while additional acyl chains are attached to the &beta; hydroxy groups of some of those primary acyl chains. Phosphate groups can be attached at position O-1, O'-4, or both.
/
/Many variations are found in the structures of lipid A molecules. Further modifications are commonly observed, such as the addition or removal of phosphate groups (see |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.29|, |FRAME: EC-3.1.3.M9|, and |FRAME: EC-3.1.3.M11|), the addition of |FRAME: PHOSPHORYL-ETHANOLAMINE| (see |FRAME: EC-2.7.8.43|, |FRAME: EC-2.7.8.42|, and |FRAME: EC-2.7.8.M9|), the addition of  |FRAME: 4-AMINO-4-DEOXY-L-ARABINOSE| units (see |FRAME: EC-2.4.2.43|), and further addition or removal of fatty acyl units (see |FRAME: EC-2.3.1.251| and |FRAME: EC-3.1.1.77|). Many bacterial species produce lipid A molecules that contain |FRAME: CPD-24440| (see |FRAME: PWY-8273|).
/
/Since the fully acylated lipid A is assembled only when attached to the core oligosaccharide, a "stand alone" lipid A, as depicted here, does not occur naturally.

/
/Algae of the |FRAME: TAX-3009| order produce fucose-rich polysaccahrides known as |FRAME: Fucoidans fucoidans|. However, fucose is a common sugar, found in <i>N</i>-linked glycans on the mammalian, insect and plant cell surface, in many bacterial glycans, and in other biomolecules.
/
/Most of the fucose found in biology is in the |FRAME: L-fucoses "L conformation"|, and the use of |FRAME: D-Fucoses| is rather rare (for example in some |FRAME: Cardenolide-Glycosides "cardenolide glycosides"|).

UNIQUE-ID - tRNAs
TYPES - All-tRNAs
COMMON-NAME - an uncharged tRNA
COMMENT - A transfer RNA (tRNA) is is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.
/
/This class encompasses uncharged tRNA molecules. The structure shown here depicts the CCA nucleotides at the 3' end of an uncharged tRNA.

COMMENT - Fucose is a hexose deoxy sugar. It received its name from the brown algae genus |FRAME: TAX-3011|, from which it was first decribed. The alga was named because of its dark redish color, as one of the meanings of the Latin word <i>fucus</i> is "red paint".
/
/Algae of the |FRAME: TAX-3009| order produce fucose-rich polysaccahrides known as |FRAME: Fucoidans fucoidans|. However, fucose is a common sugar, found in <i>N</i>-linked glycans on the mammalian, insect and plant cell surface, in many bacterial glycans, and in other biomolecules.
/
/Most of the fucose found in biology is in the |FRAME: L-fucoses "L conformation"|, and the use of |FRAME: D-Fucoses| is rather rare (for example in some |FRAME: Cardenolide-Glycosides "cardenolide glycosides"|).
/
/This compound stands for a mixture of |FRAME: CPD-10329| and |FRAME: CPD0-1107|.

TYPES - Steroid-Hormones
COMMON-NAME - an androgen
COMMENT - Androgens are steroid hormones that stimulate or control the development and maintenance of male characteristics in vertebrates, including the activity of the accessory male sex organs and development of male secondary sex characteristics, by binding to androgen receptors. Androgens are also produced by females, and are the precursors to estrogens. Present in lower concentrations than in males, androgens contribute to libido and sexual arousal in females.
/
/Important androgens include |FRAME: TESTOSTERONE|, |FRAME: 17-BETA-HYDROXY-5ALPHA-ANDROSTAN-3-O| (DHT) and |FRAME: ANDROST4ENE androstenedione|. |FRAME: TESTOSTERONE Testosterone| is the major androgen in adult males, while DHT plays a crucial role in utero, causing differentiation of the penis, scrotum and prostate. In adulthood DHT contributes to balding, prostate growth, and sebaceous gland activity.

UNIQUE-ID - CPD0-1099
TYPES - Exopolysaccharides
COMMON-NAME - a colanic acid
SYNONYMS - an M antigen
COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD0-1099 "Colanic acid"| is an exopolysaccharide secreted by |FRAME: TAX-562| and a number of other |FRAME: TAX-543| that encapsulates the organism, resulting in a mucoid appearance |CITS: [13963285]|. Colanic acid is thought to promote biofilm formation and to protect the organism when exposed to harsh environments such as acidic conditions |CITS:  [11371548][16706906]|.
/
/Even though it wasn't identified as such, colanic acid was first described in 1927 by Dorothea Smith, who isolated a polysaccharide from a mucoid strain of |FRAME: TAX-562| |CITS: [19869322]|. Fourteen years later, in a study on the antigens of the <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>, it was noticed that one antigen was common to several mucoid strains of |FRAME: TAX-57045| |CITS: [Kauffmann41]|. It was soon reported that the same antigen, which was named "M" antigen, is produced by mucoid <i>Escherichia coli</i> strains |CITS: [15406247]|. In 1954 Kauffmann reported that the antigen was common to all mucoid <i>Salmonella</i> species |CITS: [Kauffmann54]|.
/
/Similar exopolysaccharides were reported from a number of mucoid strains and species |CITS: [13475241][13641209][13963285][14073028][5324934]|. In the early 60s it was reported that a large number of <i>Salmonella</i> and <i>Escherichia</i> strains that are not normally mucoid can be induced to form slime exopolysaccharides when grown at 15 to 20&deg;C in high phosphate concentration |CITS: [Anderson61][Anderson63]|, and the exopolysaccharide was named "colanic acid" after |FRAME: TAX-562| from which it was isolated |CITS: [13963285]|. In a paper describing the discovery of the same polysaccharide in |FRAME: TAX-83333| it was suggested that colanic acid and the "M antigen" reported in the earlier studies are identical |CITS: [14206589]|. A confirmation was obtained in 1969 when it was shown that colanic acid of identical composition is produced by strains from the genera <i>Salmonella</i>, <i>Escherichia</i>, and <i>Aerobacter</i>. At that time the exact structure was not known, though it was known that the polysaccharide contains glucose, galactose, fucose, and glucuronate, as well as some <i>O</i>-acetyl groups |CITS: [ 4902806]|.
/
/Additional structural studies have shown that colanic acid from different organisms is very similar, with the polysaccharide composed of a hexasaccharide repeating unit consisting of glucose, two fucoses, two galactoses, and glucuronate. In addition, one fucose and one galactose may be acetylated to varying degrees, and the terminal galactose residue is modified. The repeat units are connected by a linkage between the first and third residues, with the remaining three residues forming a side chain |CITS: [4311825][4902692]|. Differences are found in the modifications of the terminal galactose residue, which was found to contain a 4,6-pyruvoyl group, a 3,4-pyruvoyl group, a 3,4-ethylidene group, or a 4,6-methylene group in different strains |CITS: [4941627]|. The structure shown here was published in 2007, correcting several errors in earlier reports |CITS: [17227761]|. While colanic acid was considered exclusively an exopolysaccharide that is only loosely associated with the cell surface, the 2007 study also found that colanic acid can be attached to the lipid A core of lipopolysaccharide instead of the O antigen, forming a novel type of lipopolysaccharide which was named |FRAME: 
/CPD0-1101 M<sub>LPS</sub>| |CITS: [17227761]|.

SYNONYMS - a tetrahydrofolate-glutamate
SYNONYMS - THF
SYNONYMS - THF polyglutamate
COMMENT - |FRAME: THF-GLU-N Tetrahydrofolate| (vitamin B9) and its derivatives, commonly termed folates, are required in a variety of reactions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, where they act as carriers of one-carbon units in various oxidation states. These one-carbon units are utilized in the biosynthesis of various cellular components, including glycine, methionine, formylmethionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides.
/
/During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme |FRAME: EC-6.3.2.12|, adds a glutamate residue to |FRAME: 7-8-DIHYDROPTEROATE|, resulting in |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE|, also known as H<sub>2</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>. This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:EC-1.5.1.3| (FolA) to |FRAME: THF| (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>, or tetrahydrofolate), which can be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|.
/
/Most folate molecules are modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming folate polyglutamates (or folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamates). The glutamate residues are added by an amide linkage to the &gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by peptidases or proteases, which are specific for &alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide bonds.
/
/The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives.
/
/The glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis |CITS: [10598551]|.
/
/This class stands for tetrahydrofolates with an unspecified number of glutamate residues.

COMMON-NAME - a tRNA<SUP>Gly</SUP>
COMMENT - tRNA<SUP>Gly</SUP> is the |FRAME: All-tRNAs tRNA| molecule that binds |FRAME: GLY|.
/
/|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.
/
/The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Menaquinols
TYPES - ETR-Quinols
COMMON-NAME - a menaquinol
COMMENT - Menaquinols are the reduced form of |FRAME: Menaquinones "menaquinones"|.
/
/Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are isoprenoid quinones of the naphthalene series, and are constituents of bacterial plasma membranes, where they play important roles in electron transfer and oxidative phosphorylation. Menaquinones are the most widespread respiratory quinones in biological systems |CITS: [Fujimoto12]|. Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are named MK-<i>n</i> or DMK-<i>n</i>, respectively, where the <i>n</i> refers to the number of prenyl units present in the side chain. The most common length of the side chain in bacteria is 8, although minor amounts of MK-1 through MK-14 have been found |CITS: [7022156]|.
/
/Many bacteria and archaea have |FRAME: Dihydromenaquinones "dehydrogenated menaquinones"|, which are named MK-<i>n</i>(H<sub>2</sub>). The degree and location of dehydrogenation depends on the species. Some organisms have menaquinones with modifications of the head group, for example |FRAME: TAX-2302| possess both |FRAME: CPD-15875 thermoplasmaquinones| (TPQ), which contains an extra methyl group, and |FRAME: CPD-15876 methionaquinones| (MTK), which contains a methylthio group |CITS: [11157962]|.
/
/Menaquinones are also known as vitamin K<sub>2</sub>. Vitamin K is a name given to a group of derivatives  of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone that are required by mammals for the posttranslational modification of certain proteins, mostly involved in blood coagulation. These compounds, while essential for mammals, are not synthesized by them, and are thus considered vitamins.
/
/The natural forms of the vitamin are vitamin K<sub>1</sub> (|FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE|) and vitamin K<sub>2</sub> (|FRAME: Menaquinones "menaquinone"|). Since menaquinones produced by different organisms have different tail lengths there are many variations of vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, usually specified based on the number of carbons in their tails, such as in Vitamin K<sub>2</sub>(45).

UNIQUE-ID - FORMYL-THF-GLU-N
TYPES - THF-Derivatives
COMMON-NAME - an <i>N</i><sup>10</sup>-formyltetrahydrofolate
SYNONYMS - a 10-formyltetrahydrofolate
COMMENT - |FRAME: THF-GLU-N Tetrahydrofolate| (vitamin B9) and its derivatives, commonly termed folates, are required in a variety of reactions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, where they act as carriers of one-carbon units in various oxidation states. These one-carbon units are utilized in the biosynthesis of various cellular components, including glycine, methionine, formylmethionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides.
/
/During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme |FRAME: EC-6.3.2.12|, adds a glutamate residue to |FRAME: 7-8-DIHYDROPTEROATE|, resulting in |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE|, also known as H<sub>2</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>. This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:EC-1.5.1.3| (FolA) to |FRAME: THF| (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>, or tetrahydrofolate), which can be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|.
/
/Most folate molecules are modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming folate polyglutamates (or folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamates). The glutamate residues are added by an amide linkage to the &gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by peptidases or proteases, which are specific for &alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide bonds.
/
/The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives.
/
/The glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis |CITS: [10598551]|.

COMMENT - tRNA<SUP>Leu</SUP> is the |FRAME: All-tRNAs tRNA| molecule that binds |FRAME: LEU|.
/
/|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.
/

UNIQUE-ID - Heme_I
TYPES - Hemes
COMMON-NAME - heme <i>i</i>
SYNONYMS - haem <i>i</i>
COMMENT - 'Heme' is usually understood as any tetrapyrrolic chelate of iron. The terms 'ferroheme' and 'ferriheme' refer to the Fe(II) and Fe(III) oxidation states in heme (even though Fe(IV) is found as a catalytic intermediate in some systems).
/
/|FRAME: HEME_A "Heme <i>a</i>"| was first isolated in 1951 and shown to be the active component of the integral membrane metalloprotein |FRAME: EC-7.1.1.9| |CITS: [Warburg51]|. The correct structure was published in 1975 |CITS: [170266]|.
/
/The immediate product of the initial heme biosynthesis pathways (by ferro-chelation of |FRAME: PROTOPORPHYRIN_IX|) is |FRAME: Heme-b "heme <i>b</i>"|, whose |FRAME: PROTOHEME "ferrous form"| is known as protoheme IX. |FRAME: HEME_A "Heme <i>a</i>"| differs from heme <i>b</i> in that a methyl side chain at position 8 of the D ring is oxidized to a formyl group, and a hydroxyethylfarnesyl chain is attached to the vinyl side chain at position 2 of the A ring. It is synthesized from |FRAME: Heme-b| via |FRAME: HEME_O| by two enzymes - |FRAME: EC-2.5.1.141|, and heme <i>a</i> synthase. It has been found that the latter acts by two successive hydroxylations, with the first hydroxylation forming a short-lived |FRAME: Heme_I| intermediate |CITS: [7885224][12206660]|.

/
/|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.

COMMENT - |FRAME: THF-GLU-N Tetrahydrofolate| (vitamin B9) and its derivatives, commonly termed folates, are required in a variety of reactions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, where they act as carriers of one-carbon units in various oxidation states. These one-carbon units are utilized in the biosynthesis of several cellular components, including glycine, methionine, formylmethionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides.
/
/During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme |FRAME: EC-6.3.2.12|, adds a glutamate residue to |FRAME: 7-8-DIHYDROPTEROATE|, resulting in |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE|, also known as H<sub>2</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>. This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:EC-1.5.1.3| (FolA) to |FRAME: THF| (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>, or tetrahydrofolate), which can be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|.
/
/Most folate molecules are modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming folate polyglutamates (or folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamates). The glutamate residues are added by an amide linkage to the &gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by peptidases or proteases, which are specific for &alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide bonds.
/
/The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives.
/
/The glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis |CITS: [10598551]|.
/
/Among the many folates |FRAME:5-FORMYL-THF "(6S)-5-formyltetrahydrofolate"| is the most enigmatic compound involved in the folate biosynthesis. |FRAME:5-FORMYL-THF| is the only folate derivative that does not serve as a cofactor in C1-metabolism, but it is the most frequent and stable form of folates found in plants |CITS: [8480361]|. Moreover, |FRAME:5-FORMYL-THF| is known to inhibit most of the folate dependent enzymes at physiological concentrations. The biological role of this compound is still poorly understood but it has been discussed as factor involved in the regulation of essential biosynthetic steps such as the formation of serine during photorespiration |CITS: [15888445][12207015]|.
/
/This class stands for (6<i>S</i>)-5-formyltetrahydrofolates with an unspecified number of glutamate residues.

UNIQUE-ID - Loaded-MCD-Chaperones
TYPES - MoW-MPT-cofactor-in-Protein
COMMON-NAME - a [cytidylyl molybdenum cofactor chaperone]-cytidylyl molybdenum cofactor
COMMENT - Many enzymes depend on the sulfo-form of molybdenum cofactor (MoCo). The so called maturation of MoCo involves the addition of sulfur to the Mo center, replacing an oxo group. In eukaryotes this reaction is catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-2.8.1.9| (e.g. the plant ABA3) |CITS: [11553608][15561708]|. However, prokaryotes do not have such an enzyme. In prokaryotes MoCo first binds to a chaperone (such as XdhC) before it is sulfurylated by |FRAME: EC-2.8.1.7|. Many of the prokaryotic molybdoenzymes have a specific chaperone |CITS: [23201473]|. The chaperones interact with the desulfurase, so that MoCo is sulfurated while it is still bound to the chaperone and before the insertion into the target protein. Binding to the chaperone stabilizes the sulfurated form of MoCo. Once sulfurylated, the chaperone transfer the cofactor to its target protein |CITS: [17649978]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Acceptor
TYPES - Hydride-Acceptors
COMMON-NAME - an oxidized electron carrier
SYNONYMS - A
SYNONYMS - an oxidized unknown electron donor
SYNONYMS - an oxidized unknown electron acceptor
COMMENT - In general, an electron carrier is a chemical entity that can accept or donate electrons from/to another chemical entity.
/When accepting electrons, it acts as an "electron acceptor". By accepting the electrons, the acceptor is reduced, and thus prior to receiving the electrons the entity is called  "an oxidized electron acceptor" and after receiving them it is called "a reduced electron acceptor".
/
/Many reduced electron acceptors are able to transfer the electrons to other molecules, becoming oxidized in the process. Thus the distinction between an electron acceptor and an electron donor is often not determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some acceptors in biological reactions only accept electrons and do not transfer them further. Those are often known as "terminal electron acceptors".
/
/While in general every chemical reaction in which electrons are transferred includes an electron donor and an electron acceptor, several molecules are commonly used in metabolism solely for the purpose of electron transfer, and are referred to in biology as electron carriers. Different biological electron carriers differ in the number of electrons that they transfer and in their electron affinity.
/
/Some of the common biological electron carriers transfer only a single electron (e.g. |FRAME: Cytochromes cytochromes|, |FRAME: Blue-Copper-Proteins "blue copper proteins"|, and some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer two electrons (e.g. some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer a hydride ion ( e.g. |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP|), and some transfer two electrons and two protons (|FRAME: ETR-Quinones quinones|, |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|).
/In addition, a number of inorganic small molecules (e.g. oxygen, nitrate, iron (III), manganese (IV), sulfate) are often used as terminal electron acceptors.
/
/In many cases, purified enzymes can act <i>in vitro</i> using an artificial electron carrier, and their <i>in vivo</i> electron carrier is not known. This class of "unknown electron carriers" is used to describe such reactions, which are incompletely characterized.

/
/|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.

COMMON-NAME - a jasmonate or derivative
COMMENT - The |FRAME: Jasmonates jasmonates| are a group of important phytohormones, structurally similar to animal |FRAME: Prostaglandins prostaglandins| and ubiquitous in the plant kingdom. Many forms exist, based on the structure of |FRAME: Jasmonic-Acids "Jasmonate"| (jasmonic acid, JA). The jasmonates act as regulatory molecules in many developmental processes that include fertility, sex determination, root elongation and fruit ripening. They are also potent signals activating plant defences against pathogens, herbivory, wounding and abiotic stress.
/
/The jasmonate regulation system includes the COI1 receptor protein and several JAZ (<b>JA</b>smonate <b>Z</b>IM domain) repressors, which, in the absence of jasmonate, are bound to the MYC2 transcription factors, preventing transcription. In the presence of active jasmonate molecules, COI1 interacts with the JAZ repressors, causing their |FRAME: PWY-7511 ubiquitylation|. The ubiquitylated repressors are targeted for proteasome degradation, releasing the MYC2 transcription factors and activating transcription |CITS: [19716757]|.
/
/Only two of the four stereoisomers of jasmonate occur naturally: |FRAME: CPD-731| and |FRAME: CPD-734| |CITS: [8074303][19349968]|. These two forms are present in equilibrium within cells and can interconvert spontaneously through epimerization |CITS: [8074303][19349968]|. The exact ratio of these stereoisomers within a cell has not been conclusively determined, and it may vary based on species, cell type, and physiological state. But, in the systems tested so far, |FRAME: CPD-734| is found at higher levels than |FRAME: CPD-731| |CITS:[19349968]|. The biological activity of these stereoisomers can be quite different |CITS: [8074303]|. In addition, enzymes involved in JA metabolism may have different preferences for the different stereoisomers |CITS: [17291501]|.

In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|.

TYPES - Methylated-methyl-acceptors
TYPES - THF-Derivatives
COMMON-NAME - a 5-methyltetrahydrofolate
SYNONYMS - an <i>N</i><sup>5</sup>-methyltetrahydrofolate
COMMENT - |FRAME: THF-GLU-N Tetrahydrofolate| (vitamin B9) and its derivatives, commonly termed folates, are required in a variety of reactions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, where they act as carriers of one-carbon units in various oxidation states. These one-carbon units are utilized in the biosynthesis of several cellular components, including glycine, methionine, formylmethionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides.
/
/During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme |FRAME: EC-6.3.2.12|, adds a glutamate residue to |FRAME: 7-8-DIHYDROPTEROATE|, resulting in |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE|, also known as H<sub>2</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>. This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:EC-1.5.1.3| (FolA) to |FRAME: THF| (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>, or tetrahydrofolate), which can be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|.
/
/Most folate molecules are modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming folate polyglutamates (or folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamates). The glutamate residues are added by an amide linkage to the &gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by peptidases or proteases, which are specific for &alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide bonds.
/
/The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives.
/
/The glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis |CITS: [10598551]|.
/
/This class stands for 5-methyltetrahydrofolates with an unspecified number of glutamate residues.

UNIQUE-ID - Fatty-Acids
TYPES - Carboxylates
COMMON-NAME - a fatty acid
COMMENT - The term "fatty acid" was originally coined to describe aliphatic monocarboxylic acids derived from or contained in esterified form in an animal or vegetable fat, oil or wax. However, over the years the term has been expanded to refer to additional, shorter monocarboxylic acids with an aliphatic tail such as |FRAME: PROPIONATE| and |FRAME: BUTYRIC_ACID| (but not the shorter |FRAME: FORMATE| and |FRAME: ACET|).
/
/The length of a fatty acid is determined by the length of the longest carbon chain, including the carbon of the carboxy group. Common natural fatty acids usually have an even number of carbons in the longest chain and can be either saturated or unsaturated. In many organisms they are often modified by branching, hydroxylation, methylation, epoxidation and other types of modifications.
/
/Inside living cells fatty acids are rarely found in free form. They are usually bound to coenzyme A or acyl-carrier proteins, or form part of |FRAME: Triacylglycerides triglycerides|, |FRAME: Phospholipids phospholipids|, |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides lipopolysaccharides|, and |FRAME: Cholesterol-esters cholesterol esters|.
/
/Many enzymes that act on fatty acids, as well as the corresponding |FRAME: Fatty-Acyl-CoAs "fatty acyl-CoAs"|, |FRAME: Fatty-Alcohols alcohols|, and |FRAME: Fatty-Aldehydes aldehydes|, have evolved to recognize substrates with a limited range of chain lengths. To classify these enzymes, it is helpful to divide the substrates into smaller groups based on their chain length. The following subgroups have been defined:
/
/|FRAME: Short-chain-fatty-acids "Short-chain fatty acids"| (SCFA) have 3-5 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Medium-chain-fatty-acids "Medium-chain fatty acids"| (MCFA) have 6-12 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Long-Chain-Fatty-Acids "Long-chain fatty acids"| (LCFA) have 13-22 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Very-long-chain-fatty-acids "Very-long-chain fatty acids"| (VLCFA) have 23-27 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Ultra-long-chain-fatty-acids "Ultra-long-chain fatty acids"| (ULCFA) have more than 27 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/Most of the natural fatty acids have an even number of carbon atoms, since their biosynthesis involves the addition of two-carbon-atom units. When a fatty acid contains only single bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Saturated-Fatty-Acids|. When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|. If it contains a double bond in the <i>trans</i> configuration, it is often referred to as a <i>trans</i> fatty acid. Most fatty acids in the <i>trans</i> configuration are not found in nature and are the result of human processing.

/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.

UNIQUE-ID - Donor-H2
TYPES - Hydride-Acceptors
COMMON-NAME - a reduced two electron carrier
SYNONYMS - a reduced unknown two electron donor
SYNONYMS - A(H2)
SYNONYMS - a reduced unknown two electron acceptor
COMMENT - In general, an electron carrier is a chemical entity that can accept or donate electrons from/to another chemical entity.
/When accepting electrons, it acts as an "electron acceptor". By accepting the electrons, the acceptor is reduced, and thus prior to receiving the electrons the entity is called  "an oxidized electron acceptor" and after receiving them it is called "a reduced electron acceptor".
/
/Many reduced electron acceptors are able to transfer the electrons to other molecules, becoming oxidized in the process. Thus the distinction between an electron acceptor and an electron donor is often not determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some acceptors in biological reactions only accept electrons and do not transfer them further. Those are often known as "terminal electron acceptors".
/
/While in general every chemical reaction in which electrons are transferred includes an electron donor and an electron acceptor, several molecules are commonly used in metabolism solely for the purpose of electron transfer, and are referred to in biology as electron carriers. Different biological electron carriers differ in the number of electrons that they transfer and in their electron affinity.
/
/Some of the common biological electron carriers transfer only a single electron (e.g. |FRAME: Cytochromes cytochromes|, |FRAME: Blue-Copper-Proteins "blue copper proteins"|, and some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer two electrons (e.g. some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer a hydride ion ( e.g. |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP|), and some transfer two electrons and two protons (|FRAME: ETR-Quinones quinones|, |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|).
/In addition, a number of inorganic small molecules (e.g. oxygen, nitrate, iron (III), manganese (IV), sulfate) are often used as terminal electron acceptors.
/
/In many cases, purified enzymes can act <i>in vitro</i> using an artificial electron carrier, and their <i>in vivo</i> electron carrier is not known. The classes of "unknown electron carriers" are used to describe such reactions, which are incompletely characterized.

Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.

UNIQUE-ID - Donor-H1
TYPES - Hydride-Acceptors
COMMON-NAME - a reduced one electron carrier
SYNONYMS - a reduced unknown one electron donor
SYNONYMS - A(H)
SYNONYMS - a reduced unknown one electron acceptor
COMMENT - In general, an electron carrier is a chemical entity that can accept or donate electrons from/to another chemical entity.
/When accepting electrons, it acts as an "electron acceptor". By accepting the electrons, the acceptor is reduced, and thus prior to receiving the electrons the entity is called  "an oxidized electron acceptor" and after receiving them it is called "a reduced electron acceptor".
/
/Many reduced electron acceptors are able to transfer the electrons to other molecules, becoming oxidized in the process. Thus the distinction between an electron acceptor and an electron donor is often not determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some acceptors in biological reactions only accept electrons and do not transfer them further. Those are often known as "terminal electron acceptors".
/
/While in general every chemical reaction in which electrons are transferred includes an electron donor and an electron acceptor, several molecules are commonly used in metabolism solely for the purpose of electron transfer, and are referred to in biology as electron carriers. Different biological electron carriers differ in the number of electrons that they transfer and in their electron affinity.
/
/Some of the common biological electron carriers transfer only a single electron (e.g. |FRAME: Cytochromes cytochromes|, |FRAME: Blue-Copper-Proteins "blue copper proteins"|, and some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer two electrons (e.g. some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer a hydride ion ( e.g. |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP|), and some transfer two electrons and two protons (|FRAME: ETR-Quinones quinones|, |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|).
/In addition, a number of inorganic small molecules (e.g. oxygen, nitrate, iron (III), manganese (IV), sulfate) are often used as terminal electron acceptors.
/
/In many cases, purified enzymes can act <i>in vitro</i> using an artificial electron carrier, and their <i>in vivo</i> electron carrier is not known. The classes of "unknown electron carriers" are used to describe such reactions, which are incompletely characterized.

COMMON-NAME - a quinone
SYNONYMS - quinone
COMMENT - Quinones are organic compounds derived from aromatic compounds, with two carbonyl groups incorporated into the ring structure with rearrangement of the double bonds where necessary. Quinones are conjugated but not aromatic.
/
/A classic example of a quinone is |FRAME: P-BENZOQUINONE|. Quinones are commonly named with a prefix that indicates the parent aromatic hydrocarbon (for example, "benzo-" for benzene, "naphtho-" for naphthalene, and "anthra-" for anthracene) with a "-quinone" suffix.
/
/Several types of quinones serve as electron acceptors in electron transport chains. Quinones can carry two electrons, and when fully reduced they are referred to as |FRAME: Reduced-Quinones quinols|. The addition of a single H atom to a quinone results in formation of a free radical called |FRAME: Semiquinones|.
/
/Many quinone derivatives often have other biological activities, such as |FRAME: CPD-11501 "vitamin K"|.

UNIQUE-ID - tRNA-Sec
TYPES - tRNAs
COMMON-NAME - a tRNA<SUP>sec</SUP>
SYNONYMS - a tRNA(Sec)
SYNONYMS - a tRNA<sup>[Ser]Sec</sup>
COMMENT - tRNA(sec) is a special tRNA that inserts selenocysteine at certain in-frame UGA codons.
/
/tRNAs are the adapters that allow synthesis of proteins from mRNAs. Each tRNA carries a specific amino acid to the ribosome for protein synthesis. There, the tRNA recognizes an RNA codon with its own three-nucleotide anticodon, thus allowing synthesis of a specific peptide based on an mRNA template.
/
/tRNA(sec) can insert selenocysteine at certain in-frame UGA codons |CITS: [3033637]|. The ability of tRNA(sec) to insert selenocysteine appears to depend on the specific sequence and folding of a stem-loop 3' to the insertion site |CITS: [1834670][1396569]|. tRNA(sec) has poor affinity for the normal elongation factor EF-Tu, instead binding to the specialized |FRAME: EG10942-MONOMER| |CITS: [2408012][2531290]|. The aminoacyl acceptor helix of tRNA(sec) promotes binding to |FRAME: EG10942-MONOMER| and prevents binding to EF-Tu |CITS: [1939093][2524495]|. 
/
/Mature tRNAs are linked via a 3' CCA sequence to their cognate amino acid in an ATP-dependent fashion by the appropriate amino-acid-tRNA synthetase, as shown in the |FRAME: TRNA-CHARGING-PWY|. tRNA(sec) is charged in a two-step process, being aminoacylated with L-serine by |FRAME: SERS-CPLX|, then having that associated amino acid converted to selenocysteine by |FRAME: CPLX0-1141|, as shown in |FRAME: PWY0-901| |CITS: [2963963][1839607]|. Subsequently, these charged tRNAs interact with the ribosome and template mRNA to generate polypeptides. The discovery of the role of tRNA in protein synthesis is reviewed in detail in |CITS: [7033244]|.
/
/tRNA(sec) varies in areas that are otherwise invariant across most tRNAs |CITS: [2963963][2529478]|. Many of these differences act to prevent incorrect addition of selenocysteine at random UGA stop codons |CITS: [1370545]|. tRNA(sec) has an unusual acceptor stem consisting of eight, rather than seven base pairs, which is required for proper function |CITS: [1702199]|. 
/
/The solution structure of tRNA(sec) has been chemically evaluated |CITS: [8510147]|.

/
/|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.

UNIQUE-ID - Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids
TYPES - Fatty-Acids
COMMON-NAME - an unsaturated fatty acid
COMMENT - |FRAME: Fatty-Acids "A fatty acid"| is a carboxylic acid with a long unbranched aliphatic tail.
/Even though fatty acids derived from natural fats and oils, such as |FRAME:CPD-195|, are usually at least 8 carbon atoms long, carboxylic acids as short as |FRAME:BUTYRIC_ACID| (4 carbon atoms) are considered to be fatty acids.
/
/When a fatty acid contains only single bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Saturated-Fatty-Acids|. When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|. If it contains a double bond in the <i>trans</i> configuration, it is often referred to as a <i>trans</i> fatty acid. Most fatty acids in the <i>trans</i> configuration are not found in nature and are the result of human processing.
/
/<b>About nomenclature</b>: Several nomenclatures are used for unsaturated fatty acids, and are not complementary. Systematic names (or IUPAC names) begin counting the carbon atoms from the carboxylic acid end, and the double bonds are labelled with <i>cis</i>/<i>trans</i> or E/Z notation, e.g. 8<i>E</i>,10<i>E</i>,12<i>Z</i>-octadecatrienoate. However, unsaturated fatty acids are often described using the omega nomenclature, which begins counting the carbon atoms from the terminal methyl carbon (designated as <i>n</i> or &omega;).
/In addition, unsaturated fatty acids are often referred to by trivial names, or by the "lipid number" as in 18:3, where 18 is the number of carbons, and 3 is the number of double bonds. This notation is ambiguous, as it does not specify the location of the double bonds.

UNIQUE-ID - Glycogens

COMMON-NAME - a glycogen
SYNONYMS - a branching glycogen
SYNONYMS - 6-&alpha;-D-(1,4-&alpha;-D-glucano)-glucan
SYNONYMS - glycogen
COMMENT - Glycogen is a highly branched glucose polymer found in archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes. It resembles plant-produced |FRAME: Starch starch| and is sometimes called "animal starch". Glycogen serves multiple functions, including energy reserve, osmotic regulation, blood glucose homeostasis, and pH maintenance. 
/
/Glycogen is formed of small chains of 8 to 12 glucose molecules linked together by &alpha; (1->4) bonds. These small chains, also known as |FRAME: Maltodextrins maltodextrins|, are in turn linked together by &alpha; (1->6) bonds. The &alpha;-1,4 linkages make up approximately 95% of the total molecule.  The &alpha;-1,6 branches accounts for 7&ndash;10% of the linkages and are evenly distributed within the glycogen particle.
/
/Since each chain (with the exception of the outer unbranched chains) supports two branches, glycogen particles grow spherically by adding tiers (a tier corresponds to the spherical space separating two consecutive branches from all chains located at similar distance from the center of the particle).
/
/Two structural levels of glycogen particles have been reported, which are tightly associated with their physiological functions: small quasi-spherical &beta; particles, as found in muscle cells, and large rosette-shaped &alpha; particles, as found in liver cells. The diameter of &beta; particles normally range from 10 to 50 nm, with an average at around 20&mdash;30 nm. The &beta; particles can stick together to form large &alpha; particles with diameters up to
/300 nm |CITS: [20196533][31244022][33996916]|. Two types of &alpha; particles have been observed: fragile and dense particles, which comprise large and dense &beta; particles with long average chain length, and stable light particles, which comprise smaller, compact &beta; particles with short average chain length |CITS: [31244022]|.
/
/Mathematical modelling predicts a maximal size for the &beta; particle beyond which further growth is impossible, as there would not be sufficient space for interaction of the chains with the catalytic sites of glycogen metabolism enzymes. The predicted upper limit is a particle consisting of 12 tiers corresponding to a 42 nm maximal diameter and including about 55,000 glucose residues. 36% of this total number rests in the outer (unbranched) shell and is thus readily accessible to glycogen catabolism without the need for debranching |CITS: [12179957]|.
/
/Although glycogen and starch are two distinct physical states of the same type of storage polysaccharide, starch is solid semi-crystalline while glycogen particles are entirely hydrosoluble |CITS: [21220783]|.

/|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in |FRAME: mRNAs mRNA| during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.

COMMENT - The term "fatty acid" was originally coined to describe aliphatic monocarboxylic acids derived from or contained in esterified form in an animal or vegetable fat, oil or wax. However, over the years the term has been expanded to refer to additional, shorter monocarboxylic acids with an aliphatic tail such as |FRAME: PROPIONATE| and |FRAME: BUTYRIC_ACID| (but not the shorter |FRAME: FORMATE| and |FRAME: ACET|).
/
/The length of a fatty acid is determined by the length of the longest carbon chain, including the carbon of the carboxy group. Common natural fatty acids usually have an even number of carbons in the longest chain and can be either saturated or unsaturated. In many organisms they are often modified by branching, hydroxylation, methylation, epoxidation and other types of modifications.
/
/Inside living cells fatty acids are rarely found in free form. They are usually bound to coenzyme A or acyl-carrier proteins, or form part of |FRAME: Triacylglycerides triglycerides|, |FRAME: Phospholipids phospholipids|, |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides lipopolysaccharides|, and |FRAME: Cholesterol-esters cholesterol esters|.

COMMENT - The peptide moiety, which is bound through its N terminus to the carboxyl group of muramate and contains alternating L and D amino acids, reveals considerable variation. The amino acid linked directly to muramate is usually |FRAME:L-ALPHA-ALANINE|, but in some cases can be replaced by |FRAME: GLY| or |FRAME: SER| |CITS: [5777324][5965240][4385976][6029599][5704800][5469569][6033749]|.
/
/The most common amino acid in the second position is |FRAME: D-GLT|, but in some cases (in a few coryneform bacteria) it is hydroxylated to |FRAME: CPD-48| |CITS: [6072398]|. In some organisms the &alpha;-carboxyl group of |FRAME: D-GLT| is modified by amidation or substituted by |FRAME: GLY| |CITS: [5965232][6064598]|, by |FRAME: GLYCINAMIDE| |CITS: [Interschick70]|, or by |FRAME: CPD0-1578| |CITS: [4683671]|.
/
/The greatest variation occurs at position 3. The residue at this position is usually a diamino acid and is involved in cross-linking through the second amino group. The most common residue at this position is |FRAME: MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE|, which is present in probably all Gram-negative bacteria and in many other organisms, such as some species of bacilli, clostridia, lactobacilli, corynebacteria, propionibacteria, Actinomycetales, Myxobacteriales, Rickettsiae, and cyanobacteria |CITS: [410379][6131881]| (see |FRAME:PEPTIDOGLYCANSYN-PWY|).
/The second common residue at this position is |FRAME: LYS|, but other substituition have been documented, including |FRAME: L-ORNITHINE| |CITS: [4884715][14152785][6035494][6031807]|, |FRAME:LL-DIAMINOPIMELATE| |CITS: [14024243][13882624][13525638][11945321]|, |FRAME: CPD-7690| |CITS: [5870104]|, and |FRAME: 5-HYDROXY-L-LYSINE| |CITS: [16562051]|. In some cases the diamino acid in position 3 is not involved in cross linking. In these cases
/the residue in position 3 can be |FRAME: N-ACETYL-L-24-DIAMINOBUTANOATE|, as in the case of <i>Clavibacter michiganensis</i> |CITS: [5704800][5119774]|, or even a monoamino acid, such as |FRAME:L-ALPHA-ALANINE| |FRAME: GLT| |CITS: [4259817]| or |FRAME: HOMO-SER| |CITS: [5119774][5119774 ][5469569]|.
/
/Position 4 and 5 are almost always occupied by |FRAME: D-ALA-D-ALA| di-peptide. In several species enterococci and lactobacilli, the terminal |FRAME:D-ALANINE| is replaced by |FRAME:D-LACTATE| |CITS: [1503450]| or |FRAME:D-SERINE| |CITS: [8852545]|, which entails resistance to the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin.

/
/Flavin can exist in two different redox states, which it converts between by accepting or donating electrons.

UNIQUE-ID - Medium-chain-fatty-acids
TYPES - Fatty-Acids
TYPES - Medium-Chain-Carboxylates
COMMON-NAME - a medium chain fatty acid
SYNONYMS - MCFA
COMMENT - The term "fatty acid" was originally coined to describe aliphatic monocarboxylic acids derived from or contained in esterified form in an animal or vegetable fat, oil or wax. However, over the years the term has been expanded to refer to additional, shorter monocarboxylic acids with an aliphatic tail such as |FRAME: PROPIONATE| and |FRAME: BUTYRIC_ACID| (but not the shorter |FRAME: FORMATE| and |FRAME: ACET|).
/
/The length of a fatty acid is determined by the length of the longest carbon chain, including the carbon of the carboxy group. Common natural fatty acids usually have an even number of carbons in the longest chain and can be either saturated or unsaturated. In many organisms they are often modified by branching, hydroxylation, methylation, epoxidation and other types of modifications.
/
/Inside living cells fatty acids are rarely found in free form. They are usually bound to coenzyme A or acyl-carrier proteins, or form part of |FRAME: Triacylglycerides triglycerides|, |FRAME: Phospholipids phospholipids|, |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides lipopolysaccharides|, and |FRAME: Cholesterol-esters cholesterol esters|.
/
/Many enzymes that act on fatty acids, as well as the corresponding |FRAME: Fatty-Acyl-CoAs "fatty acyl-CoAs"|, alcohols, and aldehydes, have evolved to recognize substrates with a limited range of chain lengths. To classify these enzymes, it is helpful to divide the substrates into smaller groups based on their chain length. The following subgroups have been defined:
/
/|FRAME: Short-chain-fatty-acids "Short-chain fatty acids"| (SCFA) have 3-5 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Medium-chain-fatty-acids "Medium-chain fatty acids"| (MCFA) have 6-12 carbons in the longest chain.

/
/|FRAME: Ultra-long-chain-fatty-acids "Ultra-long-chain fatty acids"| (ULCFA) have more than 27 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/Most of the natural fatty acids have an even number of carbon atoms, since their biosynthesis involves the addition of two-carbon-atom units. When a fatty acid contains only single bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Saturated-Fatty-Acids|. When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|. If it contains a double bond in the <i>trans</i> configuration, it is often referred to as a <i>trans</i> fatty acid.

UNIQUE-ID - CELLULOSE
TYPES - 1-4-beta-D-Glucan
COMMON-NAME - cellulose
SYNONYMS - (1,4-&beta;-D-glucosyl)<sub>n</sub>
COMMENT - Cellulose is the most common organic compound on Earth. It is a polysaccharide consisting of a linear chain of several hundred to over ten thousand &beta;(1&rarr;4) linked D-glucose units, and is the structural component of the primary cell wall of green plants, many forms of algae and the oomycetes.
/
/Cellulose is a straight chain polymer. Unlike |FRAME: Starch starch| or |FRAME: Glycogens glycogen|, there is no coiling or branching, and the molecule adopts an extended and stiff rod-like conformation. The multiple hydroxyl groups on the glucose moieties from one chain form hydrogen bonds with oxygen atoms on neighbor chains, holding the chains firmly together side-by-side and forming microfibrils with high tensile strength. 
/
/Several different crystalline structures of cellulose are known, corresponding to the location of hydrogen bonds between and within strands. Known crystalline forms are named cellulose I, cellulose II, cellulose III and cellulose IV.  Cellulose I is further divided into I&alpha; and I&beta;, with the former formed by bacteria and algae and the latter by higher plants. 
/Crystalline cellulose is not soluble. It is converted to a soluble, amorphus structure only at a temperature of 320 &deg;C.

/
/|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.

COMMENT - The |FRAME: Jasmonates jasmonates| are a group of important phytohormones, structurally similar to animal |FRAME: Prostaglandins prostaglandins| and ubiquitous in the plant kingdom. Many forms exist, based on the structure of |FRAME: Jasmonic-Acids "Jasmonate"| (jasmonic acid, JA). The jasmonates act as regulatory molecules in many developmental processes that include fertility, sex determination, root elongation and fruit ripening. They are also potent signals activating plant defences against pathogens, herbivory, wounding and abiotic stress.
/
/The jasmonate regulation system includes the COI1 receptor protein and several JAZ (<b>JA</b>smonate <b>Z</b>IM domain) repressors, which, in the absence of jasmonate, are bound to the MYC2 transcription factors, preventing transcription. In the presence of active jasmonate molecules, COI1 interacts with the JAZ repressors, causing their |FRAME: PWY-7511 ubiquitylation|. The ubiquitylated repressors are targeted for proteasome degradation, releasing the MYC2 transcription factors and activating transcription |CITS: [19716757]|.
/
/Only two of the four stereoisomers of jasmonate occur naturally: |FRAME: CPD-731| and |FRAME: CPD-734| |CITS: [8074303][19349968]|. These two forms are present in equilibrium within cells and can interconvert spontaneously through epimerization |CITS: [8074303][19349968]|. The exact ratio of these stereoisomers within a cell has not been conclusively determined, and it may vary based on species, cell type, and physiological state. But, in the systems tested so far, |FRAME: CPD-734| is found at higher levels than |FRAME: CPD-731| |CITS:[19349968]|. The biological activity of these stereoisomers can be quite different |CITS: [8074303]|. In addition, enzymes involved in JA metabolism may have different preferences for the different stereoisomers |CITS: [17291501]|.

TYPES - Fatty-Acids
TYPES - Short-Chain-Carboxylates
COMMON-NAME - a short chain fatty acid
SYNONYMS - SCFA
SYNONYMS - a volatile fatty acid
SYNONYMS - VFA
COMMENT - The term "fatty acid" was originally coined to describe aliphatic monocarboxylic acids derived from or contained in esterified form in an animal or vegetable fat, oil or wax. However, over the years the term has been expanded to refer to additional, shorter monocarboxylic acids with an aliphatic tail such as |FRAME: PROPIONATE| and |FRAME: BUTYRIC_ACID| (but not the shorter |FRAME: FORMATE| and |FRAME: ACET|).
/
/The length of a fatty acid is determined by the length of the longest carbon chain, including the carbon of the carboxy group. Common natural fatty acids usually have an even number of carbons in the longest chain and can be either saturated or unsaturated. In many organisms they are often modified by branching, hydroxylation, methylation, epoxidation and other types of modifications.
/
/Inside living cells fatty acids are rarely found in free form. They are usually bound to coenzyme A or acyl-carrier proteins, or form part of |FRAME: Triacylglycerides triglycerides|, |FRAME: Phospholipids phospholipids|, |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides lipopolysaccharides|, and |FRAME: Cholesterol-esters cholesterol esters|.

/
/|FRAME: Short-chain-fatty-acids "Short-chain fatty acids"| (SCFA) have 3-5 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Medium-chain-fatty-acids "Medium-chain fatty acids"| (MCFA) have 6-12 carbons in the longest chain.

/
/|FRAME: Ultra-long-chain-fatty-acids "Ultra-long-chain fatty acids"| (ULCFA) have more than 27 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/Most of the natural fatty acids have an even number of carbon atoms, since their biosynthesis involves the addition of two-carbon-atom units. When a fatty acid contains only single bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Saturated-Fatty-Acids|. When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|. If it contains a double bond in the <i>trans</i> configuration, it is often referred to as a <i>trans</i> fatty acid. Most fatty acids in the <i>trans</i> configuration are not found in nature and are the result of human processing.

COMMON-NAME - a glycyl-[tRNA<SUP>Gly</SUP>]
COMMENT - |FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.

/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/While some AARSs are highly specific already in the activation reaction, others are less accurate. It has been estimated that around half of AARSs cannot achieve the tolerable level of fidelity in protein biosynthesis (estimated to be 1 in 3300) |CITS: [4643706]| in the synthetic reactions alone. For example, class I isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS) activates |FRAME: VAL| only 200-fold less efficiently than its cognate amino acid cognate |FRAME: ILE| |CITS: [321008]|. Class I valyl- and leucyl-tRNA synthetases (ValRS and LeuRS), as well as a number of class II AARS, also efficiently activate noncognate amino acids and transfer them to tRNA |CITS: [182209][3534789][19379069]|.
/
/In order to overcome these errors the AARSs developed hydrolytic proofreading activities. Two types of correction mechanisms are known: In pre-transfer editing, the AARS hydrolyzes the noncognate amino acid adenylate prior to transfer to the tRNA, while in post-transfer editing a misacylated tRNA is hydrolyzed after a noncognate amino acid is transferred to it.

/Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are isoprenoid quinones of the naphthalene series, and are constituents of
/bacterial plasma membranes, where they play important roles in electron transfer and oxidative phosphorylation.
/Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are named MK-<i>n</i> or DMK-<i>n</i>, respectively, where the <i>n</i> 
/refers to the number of prenyl units present in the side chain. 
/The most common length of the side chain in bacteria is 8, although minor amounts of MK-1 through
/MK-14 have been found |CITS: [7022156]|.
/
/Menaquinones are also known as vitamin K<sub>2</sub>. Vitamin K is a name given to a group of derivatives  of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone that are required by mammals for the posttranslational modification of certain proteins, mostly involved in blood coagulation. These compounds, while essential for mammals, are not synthesized by them, and are thus considered vitamins.
/
/The natural forms of the vitamin are vitamin K<sub>1</sub> (|FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE|) and vitamin K<sub>2</sub> (|FRAME: Menaquinones "menaquinone"|). Since menaquinones produced by different organisms have different tail lenghts there are many variations of vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, usually specified based on the number of carbons in their tails, such as in Vitamin K<sub>2</sub>(45).

/When a fatty acid contains only single bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Saturated-Fatty-Acids|. When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|. |FRAME: Polyunsaturated-fatty-acids "Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)"| are fatty acids that contain more than one double bond in their backbone. This class includes many important compounds, such as essential fatty acids and those that give drying oils their characteristic property.
/
/<b>About nomenclature</b>: Several nomenclatures are used for unsaturated fatty acids, and are not complementary. Systematic names (or IUPAC names) begin counting the carbon atoms from the carboxylic acid end, and the double bonds are labeled with <i>cis</i>/<i>trans</i> or (preferably) E/Z notation, e.g. (8<i>E</i>,10<i>E</i>,12<i>Z</i>)-octadeca-8,10,12-trienoate. However, unsaturated fatty acids are often described using the omega nomenclature, which begins counting the carbon atoms from the terminal methyl carbon (designated as <i>n</i> or &omega;).
/In addition, unsaturated fatty acids are often referred to by trivial names, or by the "lipid number" as in 18:3, where 18 is the number of carbons, and 3 is the number of double bonds. This notation is ambiguous, as it does not specify the location of the double bonds.

COMMENT - |FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|.

COMMENT - Some organisms produce phospholipids in which the fatty acyl chains contain cyclopropane rings. These rings are formed by tenzymes that transfer a methylene moiety from S-adenosylL-methionine to double bonds of unsaturated fatty acyl chains within the lipids.
/
/In most organisms the cyclopropane groups are <i>cis</i>-configured and are formed by the action of |FRAME: EC-2.1.1.79|, which acts only on <i>cis</i> double bonds. The |FRAME: MYCOLIC-ACIDS "mycolic acids"| of mycobacteria often contain additional <i>trans</i>-configured cyclopropane groups that are formed by |FRAME: EC-2.1.1.M101| |CITS: [16741578]|.
/
/The physiological role of cyclopropane-containing fatty acyl chains (CFA) is to stabilize the membranes by increased ordering of the chains without sacrificing membrane fluidity. This can decrease the proton permeability of phospholipid bilayers, helping the bacteria survive acid shock |CITS: [9310851][18562182][25804677]|. <i>trans</i>-configured CFA in mycolic acids were reported to be correlated with the persistence of the pathogen and to modulate the innate immune response of the host |CITS: [15710652]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Diacylglycerol-Prolipoproteins
TYPES - Protein-Modified-Amino-Acids
COMMON-NAME - an (<i>S</i>-diacyl-<i>sn</i>-glyceryl)-L-cysteinyl-[apolipoprotein]
COMMENT - A prolipoprotein contains an N-terminal signal peptide. The protein is synthesized in the cytoplasm and then translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane. The signal peptide possesses positively charged amino acid residues in the N-terminal region and uncharged amino acids in the central hydrophobic region and contains a characteristic consensus sequence called the lipobox in the C-terminal region. The lipobox sequence is Leu-(Ala/Ser)-(Gly/Ala)-Cys, where the first three residues form the C-terminus of the signal peptide. During maturation the signal peptide is removed by cleavage between the (Gly/Ala) and Cys residues, so that the cysteine residue becomes the N-terminal residue.
/
/Due to its hydrophobic region, the signal peptide is embedded in the inner membrane, thus attaching the prolipoprotein to the membrane. In Gram negative bacteria, it is facing the perisplasmic side.
/
/The first step in the maturation of lipoprotein involves the formation of a thioether linkage between the sulfhydryl group of the cysteine residue and diacylglycerol, while still embedded in the membrane. The two fatty acids connected to the diacylglycerol are also inserted into the membrane, resulting in three membrane anchors (the two fatty acids and the signal peptide). In the next step, the signal lipid is cleaves, leaving the protein attached to the membrane by the two fatty acids of the diacylglycerol molecule |CITS: [27871940]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Oxidized-Flavins
TYPES - FLAVIN
COMMON-NAME - an oxidized flavin
COMMENT - A |FRAME: FLAVIN flavin| is a chemical moiety found in the compounds |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|, both important redox cofactors involved in many important reactions in metabolism.
/
/Flavin can exist in two different redox states, which it converts between by accepting or donating electrons. The |FRAME: Oxidized-Flavins "fully oxidized form"| (or quinone form) accepts two electrons and two protons to become the |FRAME: Reduced-Flavins "fully reduced form"| (hydroquinone form). The reduced form can be oxidized to a semireduced form (semiquinone) by donating one electron and one proton. A second oxidation results in restoring the initial quinone form.
/
/The conjugated ring system of fully oxidized flavin confers a bright yellow color, and its name is derived from <i>flavus</i>, Latin for yellow.
/
/Flavins are synthesized from |FRAME: GTP| in the form of |FRAME: RIBOFLAVIN|, which is later modified into |FRAME: FMN| or |FRAME: FAD|. Since mammals cannot synthesize |FRAME: RIBOFLAVIN|, it is an essential vitamin for them.

UNIQUE-ID - GLUTAMYL-GLX-TRNAS
TYPES - L-aminoacyl-tRNAs
COMMON-NAME - an L-glutamyl-[tRNA<sup>Glx</sup>]
COMMENT - |FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.
/
/The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule with an L-glutamyl group bound to the terminal 2'-OH group, as is the case in |FRAME: TAX-562| |CITS: [17206069]|.

It is prevalent in the membrane lipids of some human tissues such as brain, testis and retina, and plays a critical role in the development and function of these tissues. It is also a precursor of different classes of icosanoid effectors involved in the regulation of many important functions in mammals |CITS: [15292371]|. Many of the compounds drived from DHA are listed under |FRAME: DHA-Derived-Metabolites|.
/
/DHA is an <i>n</i>-3 (&omega;-3) fatty acid which is defined according to the location of the last double bond at the methyl end. It is synthesized <i>de novo</i> in several microalgae as well as in some fungi. It is also produced by some marine bacteria, mostly those adapted to low temperatures and high pressures |CITS: [10220156]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Short-Chain-3-Oxo-fatty-Acids
TYPES - 3-Oxo-Fatty-Acids
COMMON-NAME - a short-chain 3-oxo-fatty acid
COMMENT - The term "fatty acid" was originally coined to describe aliphatic monocarboxylic acids derived from or contained in esterified form in an animal or vegetable fat, oil or wax. However, over the years the term has been expanded to refer to additional, shorter monocarboxylic acids with an aliphatic tail such as |FRAME: PROPIONATE| and |FRAME: BUTYRIC_ACID| (but not the shorter |FRAME: FORMATE| and |FRAME: ACET|).
/
/The length of a fatty acid is determined by the length of the longest carbon chain, including the carbon of the carboxy group. Common natural fatty acids usually have an even number of carbons in the longest chain and can be either saturated or unsaturated. In many organisms they are often modified by branching, hydroxylation, methylation, epoxidation and other types of modifications.
/
/Inside living cells fatty acids are rarely found in free form. They are usually bound to coenzyme A or acyl-carrier proteins, or form part of |FRAME: Triacylglycerides triglycerides|, |FRAME: Phospholipids phospholipids|, |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides lipopolysaccharides|, and |FRAME: Cholesterol-esters cholesterol esters|.
/
/Many enzymes that act on fatty acids, as well as the corresponding |FRAME: Fatty-Acyl-CoAs "fatty acyl-CoAs"|, |FRAME: Fatty-Alcohols alcohols|, and |FRAME: Fatty-Aldehydes aldehydes|, have evolved to recognize substrates with a limited range of chain lengths. To classify these enzymes, it is helpful to divide the substrates into smaller groups based on their chain length. The following subgroups have been defined:
/
/|FRAME: Short-chain-fatty-acids "Short-chain fatty acids"| (SCFA) have 3-5 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Medium-chain-fatty-acids "Medium-chain fatty acids"| (MCFA) have 6-12 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Long-Chain-Fatty-Acids "Long-chain fatty acids"| (LCFA) have 13-22 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Very-long-chain-fatty-acids "Very-long-chain fatty acids"| (VLCFA) have 23-27 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Ultra-long-chain-fatty-acids "Ultra-long-chain fatty acids"| (ULCFA) have more than 27 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/Most of the natural fatty acids have an even number of carbon atoms, since their biosynthesis involves the addition of two-carbon-atom units. When a fatty acid contains only single bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Saturated-Fatty-Acids|. When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|.

UNIQUE-ID - Charged-PRO-tRNAs
TYPES - L-aminoacyl-tRNAs
COMMON-NAME - an L-prolyl-[tRNA<SUP>Pro</SUP>]
COMMENT - |FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.
/
/The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule with an L-prolyl group bound to the terminal 3'-OH group, as is the case in |FRAME: TAX-562| and yeast |CITS: [17206069]|.

UNIQUE-ID - a-mature-triacylated-lipoprotein
TYPES - Protein-Modified-Amino-Acids
COMMON-NAME - an <i>N</i>-acyl-(<i>S</i>-diacyl-<i>sn</i>-glyceryl)-L-cysteinyl-[lipoprotein]
COMMENT - A prolipoprotein contains an N-terminal signal peptide. The protein is synthesized in the cytoplasm and then translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane. The signal peptide possesses positively charged amino acid residues in the N-terminal region and uncharged amino acids in the central hydrophobic region and contains a characteristic consensus sequence called the lipobox in the C-terminal region. The lipobox sequence is Leu-(Ala/Ser)-(Gly/Ala)-Cys, where the first three residues form the C-terminus of the signal peptide. During maturation the signal peptide is removed by cleavage between the (Gly/Ala) and Cys residues, so that the cysteine residue becomes the N-terminal residue.
/
/Due to its hydrophobic region, the signal peptide is embedded in the inner membrane, thus attaching the prolipoprotein to the membrane. In Gram negative bacteria, it is facing the perisplasmic side.
/
/The first step in the maturation of lipoprotein involves the formation of a thioether linkage between the sulfhydryl group of the cysteine residue and diacylglycerol, while still embedded in the membrane. The two fatty acids connected to the diacylglycerol are also inserted into the membrane, resulting in three membrane anchors (the two fatty acids and the signal peptide). In the next step, the signal lipid is cleaves, leaving the protein attached to the membrane by the two fatty acids of the diacylglycerol molecule. In most Fram-negative bacteira this is followed by acylation of the amino group of the Cys residue (carried out by apolipoprotein <i>N</i>-acyltransferase Lnt), providing a new third membrane anchor |CITS: [27871940]|.

COMMON-NAME - a reduced flavin
COMMENT - A |FRAME: FLAVIN flavin| is a chemical moiety found in the compounds |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|, both important redox cofactors involved in many important reactions in metabolism.
/
/Flavin can exist in two different redox states, which it converts between by accepting or donating electrons. The |FRAME: Oxidized-Flavins "fully oxidized form"| (or quinone form) accepts two electrons and two protons to become the |FRAME: Reduced-Flavins "fully reduced form"| (hydroquinone form). The reduced form can be oxidized to a semireduced form (semiquinone) by donating one electron and one proton. A second oxidation results in restoring the initial quinone form.
/
/The conjugated ring system of fully oxidized flavin confers a bright yellow color, and its name is derived from <i>flavus</i>, Latin for yellow.

UNIQUE-ID - Monounsaturated-fatty-acids

COMMENT - |FRAME: Fatty-Acids "A fatty acid"| is a carboxylic acid with a long unbranched aliphatic tail.
/Even though fatty acids derived from natural fats and oils, such as |FRAME:CPD-195|, are usually at least 8 carbon atoms long, carboxylic acids as short as |FRAME:BUTYRIC_ACID| (4 carbon atoms) are considered to be fatty acids.
/
/When a fatty acid contains only single bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Saturated-Fatty-Acids|. When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|. If it contains a double bond in the <i>trans</i> configuration, it is often referred to as a <i>trans</i> fatty acid. Most fatty acids in the <i>trans</i> configuration are not found in nature and are the result of human processing.
/
/<b>About nomenclature</b>: Several nomenclatures are used for unsaturated fatty acids, and are not complementary. Systematic names (or IUPAC names) begin counting the carbon atoms from the carboxylic acid end, and the double bonds are labelled with <i>cis</i>/<i>trans</i> or E/Z notation, e.g. 8<i>E</i>,10<i>E</i>,12<i>Z</i>-octadecatrienoate. However, unsaturated fatty acids are often described using the omega nomenclature, which begins counting the carbon atoms from the terminal methyl carbon (designated as <i>n</i> or &omega;).
/In addition, unsaturated fatty acids are often referred to by trivial names, or by the "lipid number" as in 18:3, where 18 is the number of carbons, and 3 is the number of double bonds. This notation is ambiguous, as it does not specify the location of the double bonds.

COMMENT - |FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Prolipoprotein-Cysteines
TYPES - PROT-CYS
COMMON-NAME - a [prolipoprotein]-L-cysteine
COMMENT - A prolipoprotein contains an N-terminal signal peptide. The protein is synthesized in the cytoplasm and then translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane. The signal peptide possesses positively charged amino acid residues in the N-terminal region and uncharged amino acids in the central hydrophobic region and contains a characteristic consensus sequence called the lipobox in the C-terminal region. The lipobox sequence is Leu-(Ala/Ser)-(Gly/Ala)-Cys, where the first three residues form the C-terminus of the signal peptide. During maturation the signal peptide is removed by cleavage between the (Gly/Ala) and Cys residues.
/
/Due to its hydrophobic region, the signal peptide is embedded in the inner membrane, thus attaching the prolipoprotein to the membrane. In Gram negative bacteria, it is facing the perisplasmic side |CITS: [27871940]|.

COMMON-NAME - a [phospholipid] fatty acid containing <i>cis</i> cyclopropane
COMMENT - Some organisms produce phospholipids in which the fatty acyl chains contain cyclopropane rings. These rings are formed by tenzymes that transfer a methylene moiety from S-adenosylL-methionine to double bonds of unsaturated fatty acyl chains within the lipids.
/
/In most organisms the cyclopropane groups are <i>cis</i>-configured and are formed by the action of |FRAME: EC-2.1.1.79|, which acts only on <i>cis</i> double bonds. The |FRAME: MYCOLIC-ACIDS "mycolic acids"| of mycobacteria often contain additional <i>trans</i>-configured cyclopropane groups that are formed by |FRAME: EC-2.1.1.M101| |CITS: [16741578]|.
/
/The physiological role of cyclopropane-containing fatty acyl chains (CFA) is to stabilize the membranes by increased ordering of the chains without sacrificing membrane fluidity. This can decrease the proton permeability of phospholipid bilayers, helping the bacteria survive acid shock |CITS: [9310851][18562182][25804677]|. <i>trans</i>-configured CFA in mycolic acids were reported to be correlated with the persistence of the pathogen and to modulate the innate immune response of the host |CITS: [15710652]|.

/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.
/
/The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule with an L-aspartyl group bound to the terminal 2'-OH group, as is the case in |FRAME: TAX-562|. The enzymes from yeast and cow are able to attach the acyl group at either the 2'- or the 3'-OH groups |CITS: [17206069]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: LIPOIC-ACID "Lipoate"| is an organosulfur compound that is used as an essential cofactor by many enzyme complexes. The functional group of lipoate is a ditholane ring, which is a cyclic disulfide.
/
/The enzyme complexes that require lipoate have a dedicated |FRAME: Lipoyl-Protein "lipoyl domain"|, and lipoate is actually produced on this domain. The precursor |FRAME: CPD-195| molecule is first attached to a specific |FRAME: LYS| residue within the lipoyl domain (producing |FRAME: Octanoylated-domains|), and is then converted to lipoate by the enzyme |FRAME: EC-2.8.1.8|, resulting in |FRAME: Lipoyl-Protein-N6-lipoyllysine|.
