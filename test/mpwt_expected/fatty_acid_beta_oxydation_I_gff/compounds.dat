UNIQUE-ID - CPD-17355
TYPES - Fatty-Acids-Within-Glycerolipids
COMMON-NAME - a [glycerolipid]-(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosahexaenoate
COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD-10244 Docosahexaenoate| (DHA) is a  22-carbon long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) with 6 methylene interrupted <i>cis</i>-double bonds |CITS: [15292371]|. It is prevalent in the membrane lipids of some human tissues such as brain, testis and retina, and plays a critical role in the development and function of these tissues. It is also a precursor of different classes of icosanoid effectors involved in the regulation of many important functions in mammals |CITS: [15292371]|. Many of the compounds drived from DHA are listed under |FRAME: DHA-Derived-Metabolites|.
/
/DHA is an <i>n</i>-3 (&omega;-3) fatty acid which is defined according to the location of the last double bond at the methyl end. It is synthesized <i>de novo</i> in several microalgae as well as in some fungi. It is also produced by some marine bacteria, mostly those adapted to low temperatures and high pressures |CITS: [10220156]|.
/
/Mammals are not able to synthesis DHA <i>de novo</i>, and instead synthesize it from the essential fatty acid |FRAME: LINOLENIC_ACID| (which they obtain in their diet) via alternating steps of microsomal aerobic desaturation and elongation |CITS: [11397798][14704315]| followed by a peroxisomal &beta;-oxidation step |CITS: [10903473]|.
/
/Like other fatty acids, |FRAME: CPD-10244| is rarely found in its free form. It is usually found either as |FRAME: CPD-17312| or |FRAME: CPD-17355 "incorporated into a lipid"|.

UNIQUE-ID - 5-METHYL-THF-GLU-N
TYPES - Methylated-methyl-acceptors
TYPES - THF-Derivatives
COMMON-NAME - a 5-methyltetrahydrofolate
ATOM-CHARGES - (32 -1)
COMMENT - |FRAME: THF-GLU-N Tetrahydrofolate| (vitamin B9) and its derivatives, commonly termed folates, are required in a variety of reactions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, where they act as carriers of one-carbon units in various oxidation states. These one-carbon units are utilized in the biosynthesis of several cellular components, including glycine, methionine, formylmethionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides.
/
/During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme |FRAME: EC-6.3.2.12|, adds a glutamate residue to |FRAME: 7-8-DIHYDROPTEROATE|, resulting in |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE|, also known as H<sub>2</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>. This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:EC-1.5.1.3| (FolA) to |FRAME: THF| (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>, or tetrahydrofolate), which can be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|.
/
/Most folate molecules are modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming folate polyglutamates (or folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamates). The glutamate residues are added by an amide linkage to the &gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by peptidases or proteases, which are specific for &alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide bonds.
/
/The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives.
/
/The glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis |CITS: [10598551]|.
/
/This class stands for 5-methyltetrahydrofolates with an unspecified number of glutamate residues.

COMMENT - Transpeptidases cross link glycan strands within newly synthesized peptidoglycan polymers and between newly made material and preexisting peptidoglycan; they also link peptidoglycan to Braun's lipoprotein (Lpp) in the outer membrane and catalyze the exchange of carboxy terminal D-alanine residues with glycine in the peptide stem. 
/
/DD-transpeptidases catalyze the cross-linking of the glycan strands between the D-alanine at position 4 of a pentapeptide stem and the <i>meso</i>-diaminopimelyl or lysyl residue at position 3 of a different side-chain.
/
/LD transpeptidases catalyze the cross linking between two <i>meso</i>-diaminopimelyl or lysyl residues of separate side-chains.

COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD-17257 <i>trans</i>-Vaccenate| is a naturally occurring trans-fatty acid produced by mammals. The name is derived from the Latin vacca (cow) since it is the main trans fatty acid in cow's milk. It is also the predominant trans fatty acid in human milk.
/
/|FRAME: CPD-17257 <i>trans</i>-Vaccenate| was discovered in 1928 in animal fats and butter |CITS: [Bertram28]|. It is formed with a conjugated isomer of linoleate known as |FRAME: CPD-15704 rumenic acid"| by biohydrogenation of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids in the rumen |CITS: [12626693]|.
/
/Another isomer, |FRAME: CPD-9247|, is produced from |FRAME: CPD-9245| by bacteria and plants. It is one of only two unsaturated fatty acids in |FRAME: TAX-562| |CITS: [6988423]| (see |FRAME: PWY-5973|). Some plant species such as |FRAME: TAX-48545| and |FRAME: TAX-73871| (<i>Doxantha unguis-cati</i> L.) produce relatively high levels of |FRAME: CPD-9245| and |FRAME: CPD-9247| in their seed oils |CITS: [CHISHOLMMJ60][CHISHOLMMJ65]|. The plant pathway is likely identical to the bacterial one (in |CITS: [20943853]|).

ATOM-CHARGES - (6 -1)
COMMENT - The term "fatty acid" was originally coined to describe aliphatic monocarboxylic acids derived from or contained in esterified form in an animal or vegetable fat, oil or wax. However, over the years the term has been expanded to refer to additional, shorter monocarboxylic acids with an aliphatic tail such as |FRAME: PROPIONATE| and |FRAME: BUTYRIC_ACID| (but not the shorter |FRAME: FORMATE| and |FRAME: ACET|).
/
/The length of a fatty acid is determined by the length of the longest carbon chain, including the carbon of the carboxy group. Common natural fatty acids usually have an even number of carbons in the longest chain and can be either saturated or unsaturated. In many organisms they are often modified by branching, hydroxylation, methylation, epoxidation and other types of modifications.
/
/Inside living cells fatty acids are rarely found in free form. They are usually bound to coenzyme A or acyl-carrier proteins, or form part of |FRAME: Triacylglycerides triglycerides|, |FRAME: Phospholipids phospholipids|, |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides lipopolysaccharides|, and |FRAME: Cholesterol-esters cholesterol esters|.
/
/Many enzymes that act on fatty acids, as well as the corresponding |FRAME: Fatty-Acyl-CoAs "fatty acyl-CoAs"|, |FRAME: Fatty-Alcohols alcohols|, and |FRAME: Fatty-Aldehydes aldehydes|, have evolved to recognize substrates with a limited range of chain lengths. To classify these enzymes, it is helpful to divide the substrates into smaller groups based on their chain length. The following subgroups have been defined:
/
/|FRAME: Short-chain-fatty-acids "Short-chain fatty acids"| (SCFA) have 3-5 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Medium-chain-fatty-acids "Medium-chain fatty acids"| (MCFA) have 6-12 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Long-Chain-Fatty-Acids "Long-chain fatty acids"| (LCFA) have 13-22 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Very-long-chain-fatty-acids "Very-long-chain fatty acids"| (VLCFA) have 23-27 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Ultra-long-chain-fatty-acids "Ultra-long-chain fatty acids"| (ULCFA) have more than 27 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/Most of the natural fatty acids have an even number of carbon atoms, since their biosynthesis involves the addition of two-carbon-atom units. When a fatty acid contains only single bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Saturated-Fatty-Acids|. When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|. If it contains a double bond in the <i>trans</i> configuration, it is often referred to as a <i>trans</i> fatty acid. Most fatty acids in the

UNIQUE-ID - Lipid-A
TYPES - Lipid-A-containing-Glycolipids
COMMON-NAME - a lipid A
ABBREV-NAME - lipid A
COMMENT - Lipid A is a lipid component of the |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides "lipopolysaccharides"| (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria. Its hydrophobic nature allows it to anchor the LPS to the outer membrane.
/
/Lipid A consists of two glucosamine units attached by a &beta;(1&rarr;6) linkage and decorated with four to seven acyl chains and one or two phosphate groups. Up to four acyl chains, often with a &beta; hydroxy group and usually 10 to 18 carbons in length, are attached directly to the glucosamine sugars at positions N-2 and O-3 (and N'-2 and O'-3, respectively), while additional acyl chains are attached to the &beta; hydroxy groups of some of those primary acyl chains. Phosphate groups can be attached at position O-1, O'-4, or both.
/
/Many variations are found in the structures of lipid A molecules. Further modifications are commonly observed, such as the addition or removal of phosphate groups (see |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.29|, |FRAME: EC-3.1.3.M9|, and |FRAME: EC-3.1.3.M11|), the addition of |FRAME: PHOSPHORYL-ETHANOLAMINE| (see |FRAME: EC-2.7.8.43|, |FRAME: EC-2.7.8.42|, and |FRAME: EC-2.7.8.M9|), the addition of  |FRAME: 4-AMINO-4-DEOXY-L-ARABINOSE| units (see |FRAME: EC-2.4.2.43|), and further addition or removal of fatty acyl units (see |FRAME: EC-2.3.1.251| and |FRAME: EC-3.1.1.77|). Many bacterial species produce lipid A molecules that contain |FRAME: CPD-24440| (see |FRAME: PWY-8273|).
/
/Since the fully acylated lipid A is assembled only when attached to the core oligosaccharide, a "stand alone" lipid A, as depicted here, does not occur naturally.

/|FRAME: Short-Chain-Alcohols "Short-chain alcohols"| have 3-5 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Medium-Chain-Alcohols "Medium-chain alcohols"| have 6-12 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Long-chain-alcohols "Long-chain alcohols"| have 13-22 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Very-Long-Chain-Alcohols "Very-long-chain alcohols"| have 23-27 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Ultra-Long-Chain-Alcohols "Ultra-long-chain alcohols"| have more than 27 carbons in the longest chain.

/Symbol Nomenclature for Glycans (SNFG) is a system for symbolic representation of glycans. The system assigns unique graphical symbols for monosaccharides, and provides a much simpler representation for complex glycans, depicting both the monosaccharide building blocks and their linkages within the glycan structure. The system is widely accepted in the literature and adopted by many major journals.

UNIQUE-ID - CELLULOSE
TYPES - 1-4-beta-D-Glucan
COMMON-NAME - cellulose
COMMENT - Cellulose is the most common organic compound on Earth. It is a polysaccharide consisting of a linear chain of several hundred to over ten thousand &beta;(1&rarr;4) linked D-glucose units, and is the structural component of the primary cell wall of green plants, many forms of algae and the oomycetes.
/
/Cellulose is a straight chain polymer. Unlike |FRAME: Starch starch| or |FRAME: Glycogens glycogen|, there is no coiling or branching, and the molecule adopts an extended and stiff rod-like conformation. The multiple hydroxyl groups on the glucose moieties from one chain form hydrogen bonds with oxygen atoms on neighbor chains, holding the chains firmly together side-by-side and forming microfibrils with high tensile strength. 
/
/Several different crystalline structures of cellulose are known, corresponding to the location of hydrogen bonds between and within strands. Known crystalline forms are named cellulose I, cellulose II, cellulose III and cellulose IV.  Cellulose I is further divided into I&alpha; and I&beta;, with the former formed by bacteria and algae and the latter by higher plants. 
/Crystalline cellulose is not soluble. It is converted to a soluble, amorphus structure only at a temperature of 320 &deg;C.
/
/Molecules with very small chain length, known as |FRAME: Cellodextrins cellodextrins|, are typically soluble in water and organic solvents.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Terpenoids Terpenoids| make up a very large family of natural products containing more than 50,000 structurally diverse compounds.
/They are categorized by the number of C5 isoprene units as follows:
/
/|FRAME: Hemiterpenes Hemiterpenoids| (one C5 unit), |FRAME: Monoterpenes monoterpenoids| (C10; two C5 units), |FRAME: Sesquiterpenes sesquiterpenoids| (C15; three C5 units), |FRAME: Diterpenes diterpenoids| (C20; four C5 units), |FRAME: Sesterterpenes sesterterpenoids| (C25; five C5 units), |FRAME: Triterpenes triterpenoids| (C30; six C5 units), |FRAME: C35-Terpenes "sesquarterpenoids"| (C35; seven C5 units), and |FRAME: Tetraterpenes tetraterpenoids| (C40; eight C5 units).
/
/|FRAME: Diterpenes Diterpenoids| (also referred to as diterpenes) are widely distributed in plants, marine invertebrates, and microorganisms. They are produced from the common isoprene precursor |FRAME: GERANYLGERANYL-PP|. The diverse carbon skeletons of diterpenes are formed through carbocation-mediated cyclization cascades catalyzed by diterpene cyclases. Diterpene cyclases are categorized into two classes, class I and class II, on the basis of their reaction mechanisms and catalytic domains.

UNIQUE-ID - Peptidoglycan-with-crosslinks
TYPES - Peptidoglycans
COMMON-NAME - a peptidoglycan with cross-links
COMMENT - The strength of the peptidoglycan polymer is obtained by extensive cross-linking between the peptide side-chains that extend from the glycan strand.
/
/The cross-linking is formed by transpeptidases and occur within newly synthesized peptidoglycan polymers and between newly made material and preexisting peptidoglycan. Cross-links are also present between peptidoglycan and lipoproteins in the outer membrane.
/
/Common forms of cross-linking enzymes are the DD-transpeptidases that catalyze cross-linking between the D-alanine at position 4 of a pentapeptide side-chain and the <i>meso</i>-diaminopimeloyl or lysyl residue at position 3 of a different side-chain; and the LD transpeptidases, which catalyze the cross linking between two <i>meso</i>-diaminopimeloyl or lysyl residues of separate side-chains.

UNIQUE-ID - ETR-Semiquinones
TYPES - Membrane-Electron-Carriers
TYPES - Semiquinones
COMMON-NAME - an electron-transfer semiquinone
COMMENT - This class holds |FRAME: Quinones quinones| that are involved in electron transfer within membranes.
/
/Quinones are organic compounds derived from aromatic compound, with two carbonyl groups incorporated into the ring structure with rearrangement of the double bonds where necessary. A classic example of a quinone is |FRAME: P-BENZOQUINONE|. Quinones are commonly named with a prefix that indicates the parent aromatic hydrocarbon (for example, "benzo-" for benzene, "naphtho-" for naphthalene, and "anthra-" for anthracene) with a "-quinone" suffix.
/
/Several types of quinones serve as electron acceptors in electron transport chains. Quinones can carry two electrons, and when fully reduced they are referred to as |FRAME: Reduced-Quinones quinols|. The addition of a single H atom to a quinone results in formation of a free radical called |FRAME: Semiquinones|.
/
/Many quinone derivatives often have other biological activities, such as |FRAME: CPD-11501 "vitamin K"|.

UNIQUE-ID - SPHINGOLIPIDS

COMMON-NAME - a sphingolipid
COMMENT - Sphingolipids are a class of lipids derived from the unsaturated aliphatic amino alcohol |FRAME: SPHINGOSINE|. They are named for the mythological Sphinx because at the time (1884) their function was enigmatic |CITS: [Thudichum84]|.
/The sphingosine backbone (often referred to as the |FRAME: Sphingoids "sphingoid base"|) is amide-linked to an acyl group, such as a fatty acid, and is often also <i>O</i>-linked to a charged head group such as ethanolamine, serine, or choline. 
/
/There are three main types of sphingolipids: |FRAME: Ceramides ceramides|, |FRAME: Sphingomyelins sphingomyelins|, and |FRAME: Glycosphingolipids glycosphingolipids|. Ceramides are the most simple sphingolipids, composed of only the sphingoid base and a fatty acid. Sphingomyelins are composed of a ceramide bound to a charged head group, usually |FRAME: PHOSPHORYL-CHOLINE|. Glycosphingolipids are composed of a ceramide with attached mono- or oligosaccharide moieties.
/
/Mammals usually produce |FRAME: PHOSPHORYL-CHOLINE|-containing |FRAME: Sphingomyelins sphingomyelins|, while plants and fungi usually produce glycosphingolipids with inositol as the head group.

UNIQUE-ID - Siderophore
TYPES - Biological-Roles
TYPES - Secondary-Metabolites
COMMON-NAME - a siderophore
COMMENT - Although iron is extremely abundant on Earth, its solubility is very low at physiological pH in aerobic environments. While iron(II) is souble, it is rapidly oxidized in the presence of oxygen into insoluble ferric oxyhydroxides. In addition, iron is often complexed with organic molecules. The concentration of free iron in body fluids is estimated to be about 10<sup>-18</sup> M |CITS: [12655062]|. The most common iron uptake mechanism used by microorganisms are ferrisiderophore acquisition systems.
/
/Siderophores are small organic compounds with a very high affinity for iron. Once secreted into the environment, siderophores efficiently solubilize and chelate iron(III). The iron-siderophore complexes (ferrisiderophores) are imported back into the cell by specific transport systems, crossing both the outer and inner membranes |CITS: [23046646]|. Once in the cytoplasm (and in some cases, in the periplasm), iron is released from siderophores by hydrolysis, proton-assisted dissociation of the complex, or reduction of the metal center |CITS: [23443998]|.
/
/Siderophores are very common in pathogenic bacteria, since iron in the host organism is usually tightly bound to proteins, resulting in an extremely low concentration of free iron in the blood.
/
/More than 500 different siderophores have now been identified. The most common siderophore use hydroxamate and/or catechol functions, attached to either linear or cyclic scaffolds, to form a hexadentate structure. Siderophore with lower denticity (tetradentate, tridentate, and bidentate) are also produced, but have a much lower affinity toward iron(III). In general, all siderophores possess a higher affinity for iron(III) than for iron(II) |CITS: [20376388]|.
/
/Most siderophores belong to one of three major groups: the |FRAME: Catecholate-siderophores "catechols"|, |FRAME: Hydroxamate-siderophores "hydroxamates"| and |FRAME: Thiazoline-siderophores "thiazolines"|. Other groups include |FRAME: Phenolate-Siderophores "phenolate siderophores"| and |FRAME: Carboxylate-siderophores "carboxylate siderophores"|. Many siderophores contain more than one type of functional groups.
/
/Some grasses are known to make siderophores as well. These |FRAME: Phytosiderophores "phytosiderophores"| are also known as mugineic acids.

Free |FRAME: L-ARABINOSE| rarely exists in the nature (though it has been found in the core of coniferous trees |CITS: [Pingman57]|). However, it is widely distributed as a component of complex nonstarch polysaccharides in plant cell walls, including many plants common in the human diet such as maize, wheat, rye, rice, sugar beets, and plant gums, and in bacterial polysaccharides. Free arabinose is formed during the degradation of complex polymers, as in |FRAME: PWY-6790|, |FRAME: PWY-8006|, and |FRAME: PWY-6813|.
/
/L-arabinose has many biomedical and health effects, especially intestinal sucrase inhibition effect |CITS: [8931641]|. In recent years it has been used as a low-caloric sweetener, with approximately 50% of the sweetness of sucrose |CITS: [Hu18]|.

TYPES - Vitamins
COMMON-NAME - a vitamin K
COMMENT - Vitamin K is a name given to a group of derivatives  of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone that are required by mammals for the posttranslational modification of certain proteins, mostly involved in blood coagulation.
/These compounds, while essential for mammals, are not synthesized by them, and are thus considered vitamins.
/
/The natural forms of the vitamin are vitamin K<sub>1</sub> (|FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE|) and vitamin K<sub>2</sub> (|FRAME: Menaquinones|). Since menaquinones produced by different organisms have different tail lenghts, there are many variations of vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, usually specified based on the number of carbons in their tails, such as in Vitamin K<sub>2</sub>(45).
/Menaquinones are synthesized by gut bacteria, and are absorbed into the blood. Thus, dietary deficiency is extremely rare in healthy individuals.
/
/There are also several synthetic forms-   vitamin K<sub>3</sub> through K<sub>9</sub>. Vitamin K<sub>3</sub> (|FRAME: CPD-3766|) is the most active of the synthetic forms.

UNIQUE-ID - a-mature-triacylated-lipoprotein
TYPES - Protein-Modified-Amino-Acids
COMMON-NAME - an <i>N</i>-acyl-(<i>S</i>-diacyl-<i>sn</i>-glyceryl)-L-cysteinyl-[lipoprotein]
COMMENT - A prolipoprotein contains an N-terminal signal peptide. The protein is synthesized in the cytoplasm and then translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane. The signal peptide possesses positively charged amino acid residues in the N-terminal region and uncharged amino acids in the central hydrophobic region and contains a characteristic consensus sequence called the lipobox in the C-terminal region. The lipobox sequence is Leu-(Ala/Ser)-(Gly/Ala)-Cys, where the first three residues form the C-terminus of the signal peptide. During maturation the signal peptide is removed by cleavage between the (Gly/Ala) and Cys residues, so that the cysteine residue becomes the N-terminal residue.
/
/Due to its hydrophobic region, the signal peptide is embedded in the inner membrane, thus attaching the prolipoprotein to the membrane. In Gram negative bacteria, it is facing the perisplasmic side.
/
/The first step in the maturation of lipoprotein involves the formation of a thioether linkage between the sulfhydryl group of the cysteine residue and diacylglycerol, while still embedded in the membrane. The two fatty acids connected to the diacylglycerol are also inserted into the membrane, resulting in three membrane anchors (the two fatty acids and the signal peptide). In the next step, the signal lipid is cleaves, leaving the protein attached to the membrane by the two fatty acids of the diacylglycerol molecule. In most Fram-negative bacteira this is followed by acylation of the amino group of the Cys residue (carried out by apolipoprotein <i>N</i>-acyltransferase Lnt), providing a new third membrane anchor |CITS: [27871940]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Polyisoprenoids
TYPES - Lipids
COMMON-NAME - an isoprenoid
COMMENT - The nomenclature of isoprenoids and their derivatives is somewhat confusing. Here are some guidelines for understanding these names:
/
/Isoprenoids are composed of repeating isoprene units. The units can be attached in either a <i>trans</i> conformation (the two carbons are on opposite sides of the double bond) or a <i>cis</i> conformation (the two carbons are on the same side of the double bond). It is common to use <i>E</i> and <i>Z</i> instead of <i>trans</i> and <i>cis</i> , respectively.
/
/The numbering of carbons in the molecule starts from the carbon attached to the hydroxyl or phosphate group. The isoprene unit furthest from the C1 carbon is called the &omega; unit. Unlike all other isoprene units, the &omega; unit is not a stereo center since the last carbon is attached to two identical methyl groups.
/
/There are two widely used naming systems, and unfortunately they refer to the isoprene units in opposite order.
/One method describes the molecule starting with the unit with the lowest carbon number (ie the one furthest from the &omega; unit), naming each of the stereo-active carbons by its number, followed by its stereo designation. For example, |FRAME:CPD-11977 "this molecule"| is referred to as 2,6-<i>cis</i>,10-<i>trans</i>-tetraprenyl diphosphate or (2<i>Z</i>,6<i>Z</i>,10<i>E</i>)-tetraprenyl diphosphate.
/According to the other method, the molecule is described by the stereoconfiguration of the molecule starting with the &omega; unit. For example |FRAME:CPD-11977| is referred to as &omega;,<i>E,Z,Z</i> tetraprenyl diphosphate. 
/
/On top of this, many of the shorter molecules have trivial names that are commonly used. Some of these names are specific for a particular stereoisomer and some are used for all stereoisomer. For example, |FRAME: GERANYLGERANYL-PP "geranylgeranyl diphosphate"| is commonly used for the all-<i>trans</i> isomer of the molecule with four isoprene units, while farnesyl diphosphate is used for all four isomers of the molecule with three isoprene units - |FRAME:FARNESYL-PP|, |FRAME:CPD-9444|, |FRAME:CPD-11293| and |FRAME:CPD-11990|.

COMMENT - Fucose is a hexose deoxy sugar. It received its name from the brown algae genus |FRAME: TAX-3011|, from which it was first decribed. The alga was named because of its dark redish color, as one of the meanings of the Latin word <i>fucus</i> is "red paint".
/
/Algae of the |FRAME: TAX-3009| order produce fucose-rich polysaccahrides known as |FRAME: Fucoidans fucoidans|. However, fucose is a common sugar, found in <i>N</i>-linked glycans on the mammalian, insect and plant cell surface, in many bacterial glycans, and in other biomolecules.
/
/Most of the fucose found in biology is in the |FRAME: L-fucoses "L conformation"|, and the use of |FRAME: D-Fucoses| is rather rare (for example in some |FRAME: Cardenolide-Glycosides "cardenolide glycosides"|).

UNIQUE-ID - Phospholipid-Cis-Cyclopropane-Fatty-Acids
TYPES - Phospholipid-Cyclopropane-Fatty-Acids
COMMON-NAME - a [phospholipid] fatty acid containing <i>cis</i> cyclopropane
COMMENT - Some organisms produce phospholipids in which the fatty acyl chains contain cyclopropane rings. These rings are formed by tenzymes that transfer a methylene moiety from S-adenosylL-methionine to double bonds of unsaturated fatty acyl chains within the lipids.
/
/In most organisms the cyclopropane groups are <i>cis</i>-configured and are formed by the action of |FRAME: EC-2.1.1.79|, which acts only on <i>cis</i> double bonds. The |FRAME: MYCOLIC-ACIDS "mycolic acids"| of mycobacteria often contain additional <i>trans</i>-configured cyclopropane groups that are formed by |FRAME: EC-2.1.1.M101| |CITS: [16741578]|.
/
/The physiological role of cyclopropane-containing fatty acyl chains (CFA) is to stabilize the membranes by increased ordering of the chains without sacrificing membrane fluidity. This can decrease the proton permeability of phospholipid bilayers, helping the bacteria survive acid shock |CITS: [9310851][18562182][25804677]|. <i>trans</i>-configured CFA in mycolic acids were reported to be correlated with the persistence of the pathogen and to modulate the innate immune response of the host |CITS: [15710652]|.
/
/The structures shown here depicts a <i>cis</i>-C13:cyclopropane within a phospholipid. This compound was randomly selected to represent a member of this compound class.

COMMENT - This compound stands for a mixture of |FRAME: CPD-11897| and |FRAME: L-LYXOSE|. In most cases, each of these compounds mutarotates quickly to form a mixture of the two, and thus it is the general rule to use this non-specific form in reactions unless it is specifically known that an enzyme can accept only one of the forms.

TYPES - Compounds
COMMON-NAME - a cobamide lower ligand ribotide
COMMENT - |FRAME: Cobamides "A cobamide"| is a corrinoid molecule based on the structure of |FRAME: CPD-20843|, a cobalt-corrinoid hexaamide that is formed from |FRAME: COBINAMIDE| by the attachment of an &alpha;-D-ribofuranose 3-phosphate residue at the 2 position of the aminopropanol chain. Cobamides serve as cofactors for a number of important enzymes.
/
/A key structural feature of cobinamides is a corrin ring with a cobalt ion in its center. Four of the six coordination sites of the cobalt ion are provided by the corrin ring, while the other two are provided by |FRAME: Cobamide-Upper-Ligands upper| (&beta;) and |FRAME: Cobamide-Lower-Ligands lower| (&alpha;) ligands, which are located above and below the ring plane, respectively. The best known cobamide, |FRAME: Cobalamins cobalamin|, contains |FRAME: DIMETHYLBENZIMIDAZOLE| as the lower ligand and either a methyl group or 5'-deoxyadenosyl group as the upper ligand.
/
/At least 16 different cobamides with structural variability in the lower ligand have been described. The 16 bases reported so far are |FRAME: BENZIMIDAZOLE|, |FRAME: CPD-18320|, |FRAME: CPD-18321|, |FRAME: CPD-18497|, |FRAME: CPD-18495|, |FRAME: DIMETHYLBENZIMIDAZOLE|, |FRAME: ADENINE|, |FRAME: CPD-18323|, |FRAME: GUANINE|, |FRAME: HYPOXANTHINE|, |FRAME: PHENOL|, |FRAME: CPD-108|, |FRAME: CPD-5723|, |FRAME: CPD-20865|, |FRAME: CPD-20864|, and |FRAME: CPD-20885|  |CITS: [24055007]|. Different cobamides may not be functionally equivalent as cofactors for cobamide-dependent enzymes |CITS: [14351147][13796808][13796809][21696461][22923412][23417488]|.

UNIQUE-ID - O-Antigens
TYPES - Polysaccharides
COMMON-NAME - a lipid-linked O antigen
COMMENT - O-antigens are part of |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides lipopolysaccharides|. Lipopolysaccharides are a major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. While they are protecting the membrane from certain kinds of chemical attacks, they also induce a strong response from animal immune systems. 
/Lipopolysaccharides contain three parts: a lipid (|FRAME: Lipid-A "lipid A"|), a |FRAME: LPS-Core-Oligosaccharides "core oligosaccharide"|, and polysaccharide side chains known as the <i>O</i>-antigen.
/
/The composition of the O-antigen varies among different strains, but in general it consists of |FRAME: O-Antigen-Repeat-Units "repeating oligosaccharide subunits"| made up of two to eight sugar residues. At least 20 different sugars are known to occur, and many of these sugars are unique dideoxyhexoses that are rarely found elsewhere in nature. The variations in sugar content of the O-antigens contribute to the wide variety of antigenic types between species and even strains of Gram-negative bacteria |CITS: [12007641]|.
/
/The presence or absence of O chains determines whether the LPS is considered smooth or rough, respectively. In addition, particular sugars in the structure, especially the terminal ones, confer immunological specificity of the O-antigen, in addition to the "smoothness" of the strain.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Cobamides "A cobamide"| is a corrinoid molecule based on the structure of |FRAME: CPD-20843|, a cobalt-corrinoid hexaamide that is formed from |FRAME: COBINAMIDE| by the attachment of an &alpha;-D-ribofuranose 3-phosphate residue at the 2 position of the aminopropanol chain. Cobamides serve as cofactors for a number of important enzymes.
/
/A key structural feature of cobinamides is a corrin ring with a cobalt ion in its center. Four of the six coordination sites of the cobalt ion are provided by the corrin ring, while the other two are provided by |FRAME: Cobamide-Upper-Ligands upper| (&beta;) and |FRAME: Cobamide-Lower-Ligands lower| (&alpha;) ligands, which are located above and below the ring plane, respectively. The best known cobamide, |FRAME: Cobalamins cobalamin|, contains |FRAME: DIMETHYLBENZIMIDAZOLE| as the lower ligand and either a methyl group or 5'-deoxyadenosyl group as the upper ligand.
/
/At least 16 different cobamides with structural variability in the lower ligand have been described. The 16 bases reported so far are |FRAME: BENZIMIDAZOLE|, |FRAME: CPD-18320|, |FRAME: CPD-18321|, |FRAME: CPD-18497|, |FRAME: CPD-18495|, |FRAME: DIMETHYLBENZIMIDAZOLE|, |FRAME: ADENINE|, |FRAME: CPD-18323|, |FRAME: GUANINE|, |FRAME: HYPOXANTHINE|, |FRAME: PHENOL|, |FRAME: CPD-108|, |FRAME: CPD-5723|, |FRAME: CPD-20865|, |FRAME: CPD-20864|, and |FRAME: CPD-20885|  |CITS: [24055007]|. Different cobamides may not be functionally equivalent as cofactors for cobamide-dependent enzymes |CITS: [14351147][13796808][13796809][21696461][22923412][23417488]|.

COMMENT - Nucleosides are glycosylamines consisting of |FRAME: Bases| bound to a |FRAME: CPD0-1110 ribose| or |FRAME: 2-DEOXYRIBOSE| sugar via a &beta;-glycosidic linkage. The nucleosides are called |FRAME: Ribonucleosides ribonucleosides| when the sugar is |FRAME: CPD0-1110 ribose|, and |FRAME: Deoxy-Ribonucleosides deoxyribonucleosides| when it is |FRAME: 2-DEOXYRIBOSE|.
/
/Common |FRAME: Ribonucleosides ribonucleosides| include |FRAME: CYTIDINE|, |FRAME: URIDINE|, |FRAME: ADENOSINE|, |FRAME: GUANOSINE| and |FRAME: INOSINE|. Examples of |FRAME: Deoxy-Ribonucleosides deoxyribonucleosides| include |FRAME: THYMIDINE| and |FRAME: DEOXYADENOSINE|.
/
/When nucleosides are phosphorylated on the sugar's primary alcohol group, the resulting phosphonucleosides are called |FRAME: Nucleotides nucleotides|.

UNIQUE-ID - Lipoyl-Protein-L-Lysine
TYPES - Protein-L-lysine
COMMON-NAME - a [lipoyl-carrier protein]-L-lysine
ATOM-CHARGES - (7 1)
COMMENT - |FRAME: LIPOIC-ACID "Lipoate"| is an organosulfur compound that is used as an essential cofactor by many enzyme complexes. The functional group of lipoate is a ditholane ring, which is a cyclic disulfide.
/
/The enzyme complexes that require lipoate have a dedicated |FRAME: Lipoyl-Protein "lipoyl domain"|, and lipoate is actually produced on this domain. The precursor |FRAME: CPD-195| molecule is first attached to a specific |FRAME: LYS| residue within the lipoyl domain (producing |FRAME: Octanoylated-domains|), and is then converted to lipoate by the enzyme |FRAME: CPLX0-782|, resulting in |FRAME: Lipoyl-Protein-N6-lipoyllysine|.
/
/|FRAME: CPLX0-782 "Lipoate synthase"| not only catalyzes the reaction, but is also the source of the two sulfur atoms.

COMMENT - Fatty acyl-CoAs are |FRAME: ACYL-COA "acyl-CoAs"| derived from |FRAME: Fatty-Acids "fatty acids"|.
/
/Many enzymes that act on fatty acids, as well as the corresponding |FRAME: Fatty-Acyl-CoAs "fatty acyl-CoAs"|, |FRAME: Fatty-Alcohols alcohols|, and |FRAME: Fatty-Aldehydes aldehydes|, have evolved to recognize substrates with a limited range of chain lengths. To classify these enzymes, it is helpful to divide the substrates into smaller groups based on their chain length. The following subgroups have been defined:
/
/|FRAME: Short-Chain-Acyl-CoAs "Short-chain acyl-CoAs"| are derived from |FRAME: Short-chain-fatty-acids "fatty acids that have 3-5 carbons in the longest chain"|.
/
/|FRAME: Medium-Chain-Acyl-CoAs "Medium-chain acyl-CoAs"| are derived from |FRAME: Medium-chain-fatty-acids "fatty acids that have 6-12 carbons in the longest chain"|.
/
/|FRAME: Long-Chain-Acyl-CoAs "Long-chain acyl-CoAs"| are derived from |FRAME: Long-Chain-Fatty-Acids "fatty acids that have 13-22 carbons in the longest chain"|.
/
/|FRAME: VERY-LONG-CHAIN-FATTY-ACYL-COA "Very-long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs"| are derived from |FRAME: Very-long-chain-fatty-acids "fatty acids that have 23-27 carbons in the longest chain"|.

UNIQUE-ID - Nitriles
TYPES - Compounds
COMMON-NAME - a nitrile
COMMENT - Nitriles are <b>organic</b> compounds that contain a functional group of a carbon atom linked by a triple bond to a nitrogen atom (known as a cyano group). Inorganic compounds that contain the cyano group are not called nitriles, but cyanides.
/
/The first nitrile to be synthesized (in 1782 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele) was that of formate, |FRAME: HCN|, which is an extremely toxic compound (it is an inhibitor of |FRAME: EC-7.1.1.9|). The name nitrile originates from the nitrile of benzoate, |FRAME: CPD-15582|, which was synthesized in 1844 by Hermann Fehling. Fehling named the compound nitrile, and the name was subsequently applied for all organic compounds that contain a cyano group.
/
/Nitriles occur naturally in many organisms, and over 120 naturally occurring nitriles have been isolated. It is particularly common in fruit seeds. The cyano group is very stable and is not readily metabolized.

UNIQUE-ID - Reduced-Quinones
TYPES - Aromatics
COMMON-NAME - a quinol
COMMENT - A quinol, or hydroquinone, is the fully reduced form of |FRAME: Quinones|.
/
/Quinones are organic compounds derived from aromatic compounds, with two carbonyl groups incorporated into the ring structure with rearrangement of the double bonds where necessary. Quinones are conjugated but not aromatic.
/
/A classic example of a quinone is |FRAME: P-BENZOQUINONE|. Quinones are commonly named with a prefix that indicates the parent aromatic hydrocarbon (for example, "benzo-" for benzene, "naphtho-" for naphthalene, and "anthra-" for anthracene) with a "-quinone" suffix.
/
/Several types of quinones serve as electron acceptors in electron transport chains. Quinones can carry two electrons, and when fully reduced they are referred to as |FRAME: Reduced-Quinones quinols|. The addition of a single H atom to a quinone results in formation of a free radical called |FRAME: Semiquinones|.
/
/Many quinone derivatives often have other biological activities, such as |FRAME: CPD-11501 "vitamin K"|.

UNIQUE-ID - Short-chain-fatty-acids
TYPES - Fatty-Acids
TYPES - Short-Chain-Carboxylates
COMMON-NAME - a short chain fatty acid
ATOM-CHARGES - (5 -1)
COMMENT - The term "fatty acid" was originally coined to describe aliphatic monocarboxylic acids derived from or contained in esterified form in an animal or vegetable fat, oil or wax. However, over the years the term has been expanded to refer to additional, shorter monocarboxylic acids with an aliphatic tail such as |FRAME: PROPIONATE| and |FRAME: BUTYRIC_ACID| (but not the shorter |FRAME: FORMATE| and |FRAME: ACET|).
/
/The length of a fatty acid is determined by the length of the longest carbon chain, including the carbon of the carboxy group. Common natural fatty acids usually have an even number of carbons in the longest chain and can be either saturated or unsaturated. In many organisms they are often modified by branching, hydroxylation, methylation, epoxidation and other types of modifications.

They are polyunsaturated fatty acids with a double bond (C=C) starting after the third carbon atom from the end of the carbon chain. The fatty acids have two endsthe acid (COOH) end and the methyl (CH3) end. The location of the first double bond is counted from the methyl end, which is also known as the omega (&omega;) end or the n end.

UNIQUE-ID - Long-Chain-Fatty-Acids
TYPES - Fatty-Acids
COMMON-NAME - a long-chain fatty acid
ATOM-CHARGES - (14 -1)
COMMENT - The term "fatty acid" was originally coined to describe aliphatic monocarboxylic acids derived from or contained in esterified form in an animal or vegetable fat, oil or wax. However, over the years the term has been expanded to refer to additional, shorter monocarboxylic acids with an aliphatic tail such as |FRAME: PROPIONATE| and |FRAME: BUTYRIC_ACID| (but not the shorter |FRAME: FORMATE| and |FRAME: ACET|).
/
/The length of a fatty acid is determined by the length of the longest carbon chain, including the carbon of the carboxy group. Common natural fatty acids usually have an even number of carbons in the longest chain and can be either saturated or unsaturated. In many organisms they are often modified by branching, hydroxylation, methylation, epoxidation and other types of modifications.
/
/Inside living cells fatty acids are rarely found in free form. They are usually bound to coenzyme A or acyl-carrier proteins, or form part of |FRAME: Triacylglycerides triglycerides|, |FRAME: Phospholipids phospholipids|, |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides lipopolysaccharides|, and |FRAME: Cholesterol-esters cholesterol esters|.
/
/Many enzymes that act on fatty acids, as well as the corresponding |FRAME: Fatty-Acyl-CoAs "fatty acyl-CoAs"|, alcohols, and aldehydes, have evolved to recognize substrates with a limited range of chain lengths.

UNIQUE-ID - Oxidized-Flavins
TYPES - FLAVIN
COMMON-NAME - an oxidized flavin
COMMENT - A |FRAME: FLAVIN flavin| is a chemical moiety found in the compounds |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|, both important redox cofactors involved in many important reactions in metabolism.
/
/Flavin can exist in two different redox states, which it converts between by accepting or donating electrons. The |FRAME: Oxidized-Flavins "fully oxidized form"| (or quinone form) accepts two electrons and two protons to become the |FRAME: Reduced-Flavins "fully reduced form"| (hydroquinone form). The reduced form can be oxidized to a semireduced form (semiquinone) by donating one electron and one proton. A second oxidation results in restoring the initial quinone form.
/
/The conjugated ring system of fully oxidized flavin confers a bright yellow color, and its name is derived from <i>flavus</i>, Latin for yellow.
/
/Flavins are synthesized from |FRAME: GTP| in the form of |FRAME: RIBOFLAVIN|, which is later modified into |FRAME: FMN| or |FRAME: FAD|. Since mammals cannot synthesize |FRAME: RIBOFLAVIN|, it is an essential vitamin for them.

UNIQUE-ID - L-1-PHOSPHATIDYL-GLYCEROL
TYPES - Glycerophosphodiesters
TYPES - Phosphoglycerides
COMMON-NAME - a phosphatidylglycerol
ATOM-CHARGES - (14 -1)
COMMENT - The structure of |FRAME: L-1-PHOSPHATIDYL-GLYCEROL phosphatidylglycerol| (PG) was determined  in 1958 from lipid isolates of single-cell green algae from the |FRAME: TAX-3087| genus |CITS: [13510267]|. Its structure is analogous to phosphatidylinositol (PI), but with a glyceryl moiety replacing the inosityl moiety of PI. 
/
/Within a decade it has been found in higher plants |CITS: [Benson61]|, Gram-negative bacteria |CITS: [4868364][4295332]| and mammals |CITS: [5660098]|. It was later discovered in the archaeon |FRAME: TAX-2246|, indicating that it is produced by all three domains of life. The biosynthetic pathway was elucidated in the early 60s |CITS: [14033231]|, and a laboratory synthesis was completed a few years later |CITS: [5916374]|.
/
/The abundance of PG is relatively low compared with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in prokaryotes or with either PE or phosphatidylcholine (PC) in eukaryotes |CITS: [18216768][20671299][21172818]|. It is typically more concentrated in plant systems than in animals, forming 1.5-4&middot;5% of the lipid fraction |CITS: [23532185][3592680]|
/
/Since its discovery, biochemical research into PG has been dominated by its roles in the surfactant of lung tissue (PG is the second largest lipid constituent of lung surfactant in almost all mammals), chloroplast membranes (PG is the only phospholipid found in chloroplast thylakoids) and in both bacterial and mammalian systems.

COMMENT - Fatty acyl-CoAs are |FRAME: ACYL-COA "acyl-CoAs"| derived from |FRAME: Fatty-Acids "fatty acids"|.
/
/Many enzymes that act on fatty acids, as well as the corresponding |FRAME: Fatty-Acyl-CoAs "fatty acyl-CoAs"|, alcohols, and aldehydes, have evolved to recognize substrates with a limited range of chain lengths. To classify these enzymes, it is helpful to divide the substrates into smaller groups based on their chain length. The following subgroups have been defined:
/
/|FRAME: Short-Chain-Acyl-CoAs "Short-chain acyl-CoAs"|  are derived from |FRAME: Short-chain-fatty-acids "fatty acids that have 3-5 carbons in the longest chain"|.
/
/|FRAME: Medium-Chain-Acyl-CoAs "Medium-chain acyl-CoAs"|  are derived from |FRAME: Medium-chain-fatty-acids "fatty acids that have 6-12 carbons in the longest chain"|.
/
/|FRAME: Long-Chain-Acyl-CoAs "Long-chain acyl-CoAs"| are derived from |FRAME: Long-Chain-Fatty-Acids "fatty acids that have 13-22 carbons in the longest chain"|.
/
/|FRAME: VERY-LONG-CHAIN-FATTY-ACYL-COA "Very-long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs"| are derived from |FRAME: Very-long-chain-fatty-acids "fatty acids that have 23-27 carbons in the longest chain"|.
/
/|FRAME: Ultra-Long-Chain-Acyl-CoAs "Ultra-long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs"| are derived from |FRAME: Ultra-long-chain-fatty-acids "fatty acids that have more than 27 carbons in the longest chain"|.

COMMON-NAME - a carbohydrate
COMMENT - An older definition of carbohydrates stated that they contain only carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. As the term was originally applied only to monosaccharides, the name was formulated in recognition of the fact that their empirical composition can be expressed as C<i><sub>n</sub></i>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<i><sub>n</sub></i>.
/
/However, the term is now used in a much wider sense and includes |FRAME: Monosaccharides monosaccharides|, |FRAME: Disaccharides disaccharides|, |FRAME: Oligosaccharides oligosaccharides| and |FRAME: Polysaccharides polysaccharides| as well as substances derived from monosaccharides by reduction of the carbonyl group (|FRAME: Sugar-alcohols alditols|), by oxidation of one or more terminal groups to |FRAME: Carboxylates "carboxylic acids"|, or by replacement of one or more hydroxy group(s) by a hydrogen atom, an amino group, a sulfhydryl group or similar heteroatomic groups. It also includes oligo- and polysaccharides consisting of such modified monosaccharides, as well as derivatives of these compounds. 
/
/An exception is |FRAME: Cyclitols cyclitols|, which are generally not regarded as carbohydrates.

UNIQUE-ID - Hydride-Acceptors
TYPES - Redox-Electron-Carriers
COMMON-NAME - an unknown electron carrier
COMMENT - In general, an electron carrier is a chemical entity that can accept or donate electrons from/to another chemical entity.
/When accepting electrons, it acts as an "electron acceptor". By accepting the electrons, the acceptor is reduced, and thus prior to receiving the electrons the entity is called  "an oxidized electron acceptor" and after receiving them it is called "a reduced electron acceptor".
/
/Many reduced electron acceptors are able to transfer the electrons to other molecules, becoming oxidized in the process. Thus the distinction between an electron acceptor and an electron donor is often not determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some acceptors in biological reactions only accept electrons and do not transfer them further. Those are often known as "terminal electron acceptors".
/
/While in general every chemical reaction in which electrons are transferred includes an electron donor and an electron acceptor, several molecules are commonly used in metabolism solely for the purpose of electron transfer, and are referred to in biology as electron carriers. Different biological electron carriers differ in the number of electrons that they transfer and in their electron affinity.
/
/Some of the common biological electron carriers transfer only a single electron (e.g. |FRAME: Cytochromes cytochromes|, |FRAME: Blue-Copper-Proteins "blue copper proteins"|, and some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer two electrons (e.g. some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer a hydride ion ( e.g. |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP|), and some transfer two electrons and two protons (|FRAME: ETR-Quinones quinones|, |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|).
/In addition, a number of inorganic small molecules (e.g. oxygen, nitrate, iron (III), manganese (IV), sulfate) are often used as terminal electron acceptors.
/
/In many cases, purified enzymes can act <i>in vitro</i> using an artificial electron carrier, and their <i>in vivo</i> electron carrier is not known. This class of "unknown electron carriers" is used to describe such reactions, which are incompletely characterized.

UNIQUE-ID - Cofactors
TYPES - Biological-Roles
COMMON-NAME - an enzyme cofactor
COMMENT - An enzyme cofactor is a non-protein chemical compound that is required by an enzyme for catalysis of a chemical reaction. Cofactors associate with inactive <i>apo</i>-enzymes, resulting in formation of active <i>holo</i>-enzymes.
/Unlike cosubstrates, the cofactors are restored to their original state at the end of the catalytic cycle and are thus not included in the reaction equation.
/
/Cofactors can be inorganic ions (e.g. Ca<sup>2+</sup>), inorganic molecules (e.g. |FRAME: FeS-Centers|) or organic molecules (e.g. |FRAME: PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE|). Some compounds may act as cofactors for a particular enzyme and a cosubstrate for a different enzyme, depending on whether they are restored to their active state at the end of the reaction. 
/Cofactors that are tightly bound to an enzyme have often been referred to as prosthetic groups. It should be noted that the degree of tightness required for this definition has not been defined, and that the same cofactor may bind differently to different enzymes, making this term imprecise. Thus, it is recommended not to use it. Organic cofactors that are loosely bound to the enzyme have been often referred to as coenzymes. However, that term is also imprecise, and it is recommended not to use it either.

UNIQUE-ID - Lactones
TYPES - Esters
COMMON-NAME - a lactone
COMMENT - A |FRAME: Lactones "lactone"| is a cyclic ester, the product of condensation of an alcohol group and a carboxylate group
/within the same molecule. It is characterized by a closed ring consisting of two or more carbon atoms and a single oxygen atom, with a ketone group in one of the carbons adjacent to the ring oxygen.
/
/There are several types of lactones - |FRAME: Beta-lactones| contain 3 carbons in the ring,
/|FRAME:Gamma-lactones| contains 4, |FRAME:Delta-lactones| contains 5, and |FRAME:Epsilon-lactones|
/contains 6 carbons.
/
/The most stable structure for lactones are &gamma;-lactones and &delta;-lactones, because of the
/minimal angle strain in their structure. In fact, &gamma;-lactones are so stable that, in the presence of
/dilute acids at room temperature, 4-hydroxy acids esterify and cyclize spontaneously to form lactones.
/&beta;-lactones, on the other hand, are not very stable.
/
/The name lactone is derived from the lactone of |FRAME: L-LACTATE|, which is called
/|FRAME: CPD-9549|, although it is really a di-lactone.

ABBREV-NAME - DMKH<sub>2</sub>
COMMENT - Menaquinols are the reduced form of |FRAME: Menaquinones "menaquinones"|.
/
/Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are isoprenoid quinones of the naphthalene series, and are constituents of
/bacterial plasma membranes, where they play important roles in electron transfer and oxidative phosphorylation.
/Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are named MK-<i>n</i> or DMK-<i>n</i>, respectively, where the <i>n</i> 
/refers to the number of prenyl units present in the side chain. 
/The most common length of the side chain in bacteria is 8, although minor amounts of MK-1 through
/MK-14 have been found |CITS: [7022156]|.
/
/Menaquinones are also known as vitamin K<sub>2</sub>. Vitamin K is a name given to a group of derivatives  of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone that are required by mammals for the posttranslational modification of certain proteins, mostly involved in blood coagulation. These compounds, while essential for mammals, are not synthesized by them, and are thus considered vitamins.
/
/The natural forms of the vitamin are vitamin K<sub>1</sub> (|FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE|) and vitamin K<sub>2</sub> (|FRAME: Menaquinones "menaquinone"|). Since menaquinones produced by different organisms have different tail lenghts there are many variations of vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, usually specified based on the number of carbons in their tails, such as in Vitamin K<sub>2</sub>(45).

UNIQUE-ID - Short-Chain-3-Oxo-fatty-Acids
TYPES - 3-Oxo-Fatty-Acids
COMMON-NAME - a short-chain 3-oxo-fatty acid
ATOM-CHARGES - (6 -1)
COMMENT - The term "fatty acid" was originally coined to describe aliphatic monocarboxylic acids derived from or contained in esterified form in an animal or vegetable fat, oil or wax. However, over the years the term has been expanded to refer to additional, shorter monocarboxylic acids with an aliphatic tail such as |FRAME: PROPIONATE| and |FRAME: BUTYRIC_ACID| (but not the shorter |FRAME: FORMATE| and |FRAME: ACET|).
/
/The length of a fatty acid is determined by the length of the longest carbon chain, including the carbon of the carboxy group. Common natural fatty acids usually have an even number of carbons in the longest chain and can be either saturated or unsaturated. In many organisms they are often modified by branching, hydroxylation, methylation, epoxidation and other types of modifications.
/
/Inside living cells fatty acids are rarely found in free form. They are usually bound to coenzyme A or acyl-carrier proteins, or form part of |FRAME: Triacylglycerides triglycerides|, |FRAME: Phospholipids phospholipids|, |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides lipopolysaccharides|, and |FRAME: Cholesterol-esters cholesterol esters|.
/
/Many enzymes that act on fatty acids, as well as the corresponding |FRAME: Fatty-Acyl-CoAs "fatty acyl-CoAs"|, |FRAME: Fatty-Alcohols alcohols|, and |FRAME: Fatty-Aldehydes aldehydes|, have evolved to recognize substrates with a limited range of chain lengths. To classify these enzymes, it is helpful to divide the substrates into smaller groups based on their chain length. The following subgroups have been defined:
/
/|FRAME: Short-chain-fatty-acids "Short-chain fatty acids"| (SCFA) have 3-5 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Medium-chain-fatty-acids "Medium-chain fatty acids"| (MCFA) have 6-12 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Long-Chain-Fatty-Acids "Long-chain fatty acids"| (LCFA) have 13-22 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Very-long-chain-fatty-acids "Very-long-chain fatty acids"| (VLCFA) have 23-27 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Ultra-long-chain-fatty-acids "Ultra-long-chain fatty acids"| (ULCFA) have more than 27 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/Most of the natural fatty acids have an even number of carbon atoms, since their biosynthesis involves the addition of two-carbon-atom units. When a fatty acid contains only single bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Saturated-Fatty-Acids|. When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|. If it contains a double bond in the <i>trans</i> configuration, it is often referred to as a <i>trans</i> fatty acid. Most fatty acids in the

COMMON-NAME - a jasmonate
ATOM-CHARGES - (14 -1)
CHEMICAL-FORMULA - (C 12)
CHEMICAL-FORMULA - (H 17)
CHEMICAL-FORMULA - (O 3)
COMMENT - The |FRAME: Jasmonates jasmonates| are a group of important phytohormones, structurally similar to animal |FRAME: Prostaglandins prostaglandins| and ubiquitous in the plant kingdom. Many forms exist, based on the structure of |FRAME: Jasmonic-Acids "Jasmonate"| (jasmonic acid, JA). The jasmonates act as regulatory molecules in many developmental processes that include fertility, sex determination, root elongation and fruit ripening. They are also potent signals activating plant defences against pathogens, herbivory, wounding and abiotic stress.
/
/The jasmonate regulation system includes the COI1 receptor protein and several JAZ (<b>JA</b>smonate <b>Z</b>IM domain) repressors, which, in the absence of jasmonate, are bound to the MYC2 transcription factors, preventing transcription. In the presence of active jasmonate molecules, COI1 interacts with the JAZ repressors, causing their |FRAME: PWY-7511 ubiquitylation|. The ubiquitylated repressors are targeted for proteasome degradation, releasing the MYC2 transcription factors and activating transcription |CITS: [19716757]|.
/
/Only two of the four stereoisomers of jasmonate occur naturally: |FRAME: CPD-731| and |FRAME: CPD-734| |CITS: [8074303][19349968]|. These two forms are present in equilibrium within cells and can interconvert spontaneously through epimerization |CITS: [8074303][19349968]|. The exact ratio of these stereoisomers within a cell has not been conclusively determined, and it may vary based on species, cell type, and physiological state. But, in the systems tested so far, |FRAME: CPD-734| is found at higher levels than |FRAME: CPD-731| |CITS:[19349968]|. The biological activity of these stereoisomers can be quite different |CITS: [8074303]|. In addition, enzymes involved in JA metabolism may have different preferences for the different stereoisomers |CITS: [17291501]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Jasmonates
TYPES - Plant-Hormones
COMMON-NAME - a jasmonate or derivative
ATOM-CHARGES - (13 -1)
COMMENT - The |FRAME: Jasmonates jasmonates| are a group of important phytohormones, structurally similar to animal |FRAME: Prostaglandins prostaglandins| and ubiquitous in the plant kingdom. Many forms exist, based on the structure of |FRAME: Jasmonic-Acids "Jasmonate"| (jasmonic acid, JA). The jasmonates act as regulatory molecules in many developmental processes that include fertility, sex determination, root elongation and fruit ripening. They are also potent signals activating plant defences against pathogens, herbivory, wounding and abiotic stress.
/
/The jasmonate regulation system includes the COI1 receptor protein and several JAZ (<b>JA</b>smonate <b>Z</b>IM domain) repressors, which, in the absence of jasmonate, are bound to the MYC2 transcription factors, preventing transcription. In the presence of active jasmonate molecules, COI1 interacts with the JAZ repressors, causing their |FRAME: PWY-7511 ubiquitylation|. The ubiquitylated repressors are targeted for proteasome degradation, releasing the MYC2 transcription factors and activating transcription |CITS: [19716757]|.
/
/Only two of the four stereoisomers of jasmonate occur naturally: |FRAME: CPD-731| and |FRAME: CPD-734| |CITS: [8074303][19349968]|. These two forms are present in equilibrium within cells and can interconvert spontaneously through epimerization |CITS: [8074303][19349968]|. The exact ratio of these stereoisomers within a cell has not been conclusively determined, and it may vary based on species, cell type, and physiological state. But, in the systems tested so far, |FRAME: CPD-734| is found at higher levels than |FRAME: CPD-731| |CITS:[19349968]|. The biological activity of these stereoisomers can be quite different |CITS: [8074303]|. In addition, enzymes involved in JA metabolism may have different preferences for the different stereoisomers |CITS: [17291501]|.
/
/This master class includes a large set of cyclopentanone derivatives of |FRAME: Jasmonic-Acids "jasmonate"|. Confusingly, these compounds are often referred to collectively by the name "jasmonates".

COMMENT - 'Heme' is usually understood as any tetrapyrrolic chelate of iron. The terms 'ferroheme' and 'ferriheme' refer to the Fe(II) and Fe(III) oxidation states in heme (even though Fe(IV) is found as a catalytic intermediate in some systems).
/
/|FRAME: HEME_A "Heme <i>a</i>"| was first isolated in 1951 and shown to be the active component of the integral membrane metalloprotein |FRAME: EC-7.1.1.9| |CITS: [Warburg51]|. The correct structure was published in 1975 |CITS: [170266]|.
/
/The immediate product of the initial heme biosynthesis pathways (by ferro-chelation of |FRAME: PROTOPORPHYRIN_IX|) is |FRAME: Heme-b "heme <i>b</i>"|, whose |FRAME: PROTOHEME "ferrous form"| is known as protoheme IX. |FRAME: HEME_A "Heme <i>a</i>"| differs from heme <i>b</i> in that a methyl side chain at position 8 of the D ring is oxidized to a formyl group, and a hydroxyethylfarnesyl chain is attached to the vinyl side chain at position 2 of the A ring. It is synthesized from |FRAME: Heme-b| via |FRAME: HEME_O| by two enzymes - |FRAME: EC-2.5.1.141|, and heme <i>a</i> synthase. It has been found that the latter acts by two successive hydroxylations, with the first hydroxylation forming a short-lived |FRAME: Heme_I| intermediate |CITS: [7885224][12206660]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Reduced-Flavins
TYPES - FLAVIN
COMMON-NAME - a reduced flavin
COMMENT - A |FRAME: FLAVIN flavin| is a chemical moiety found in the compounds |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|, both important redox cofactors involved in many important reactions in metabolism.
/
/Flavin can exist in two different redox states, which it converts between by accepting or donating electrons. The |FRAME: Oxidized-Flavins "fully oxidized form"| (or quinone form) accepts two electrons and two protons to become the |FRAME: Reduced-Flavins "fully reduced form"| (hydroquinone form). The reduced form can be oxidized to a semireduced form (semiquinone) by donating one electron and one proton. A second oxidation results in restoring the initial quinone form.
/
/The conjugated ring system of fully oxidized flavin confers a bright yellow color, and its name is derived from <i>flavus</i>, Latin for yellow.
/
/Flavins are synthesized from |FRAME: GTP| in the form of |FRAME: RIBOFLAVIN|, which is later modified into |FRAME: FMN| or |FRAME: FAD|. Since mammals cannot synthesize |FRAME: RIBOFLAVIN|, it is an essential vitamin for them.

COMMENT - Nucleobases are the parts of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) that are involved in pairing of the two strands.
/The primary nucleobases are |FRAME: CYTOSINE|, |FRAME: GUANINE|, |FRAME: ADENINE| (found in both DNA and RNA), |FRAME: THYMINE| (found only in DNA) and |FRAME: URACIL| (found only in RNA), abbreviated as C, G, A, T, and U, respectively. There are many additional nucleobases, usually derived from the primary ones.
/
/Based on their structure, nucleobases are divided into |FRAME: Purines purines| and |FRAME: Pyrimidine-Bases pyrimidines|.

COMMON-NAME - a 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate
ATOM-CHARGES - (32 -1)
ATOM-CHARGES - (27 1)
COMMENT - |FRAME: THF-GLU-N Tetrahydrofolate| (vitamin B9) and its derivatives, commonly termed folates, are required in a variety of reactions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, where they act as carriers of one-carbon units in various oxidation states. These one-carbon units are utilized in the biosynthesis of several cellular components, including glycine, methionine, formylmethionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides.
/
/During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme |FRAME: EC-6.3.2.12|, adds a glutamate residue to |FRAME: 7-8-DIHYDROPTEROATE|, resulting in |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE|, also known as H<sub>2</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>. This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:EC-1.5.1.3| (FolA) to |FRAME: THF| (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>, or tetrahydrofolate), which can be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|.
/
/Most folate molecules are modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming folate polyglutamates (or folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamates). The glutamate residues are added by an amide linkage to the &gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by peptidases or proteases, which are specific for &alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide bonds.
/
/The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives.
/
/The glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis |CITS: [10598551]|.
/
/This class stands for 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolates with an unspecified number of glutamate residues.

COMMENT - Sialic acids are an important family of related 9-carbon sugars acids, present on the surface of many different cells and functioning in a wide range of different biological processes.
/
/<i>N</i>-acetylneuraminate, the most ubiquitous species amongst the sialic acids, is widely distributed in the
/animal kingdom as a component of oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, and glycolipids.
/<i>N</i>-acetylneuraminate carries out various biological functions by acting as receptors for
/microorganisms, viruses, toxins, and hormones, by masking receptors, and by regulation of the immune
/system.
/
/N-acetylneuraminic acid is the predominant form of sialic acid present in humans. It can be found as a terminal sugar on a wide range of surface glycoconjugates |CITS: [11841250]|. The &alpha;-anomer is the form that is found when sialic acid is bound to glycans, but in solution it exists mainly (over 90%) in the &beta;-anomeric form |CITS: [18063573]|. 
/
/A number of bacteria that can colonize humans make use of N-acetylneuraminic acid as a nutrient source. In addition, some pathogens such as |FRAME: TAX-727| use sialic acid in an immune evasion mechanism by adding N-acetylneuraminic acid to their lipopolysaccharide |CITS: [12180977][10447878]|, which provides increased survival in human serum. Most of these organisms are not capable of synthesizing N-acetylneuraminic acid and import it into the cells |CITS: [16262798]| after conversion (either spontaneous or enzymatic) to the &beta;-anomer |CITS: [18063573]| .

CHEMICAL-FORMULA - (C 6)

COMMENT - Fucose is a hexose deoxy sugar. It received its name from the brown algae genus |FRAME: TAX-3011|, from which it was first decribed. The alga was named because of its dark redish color, as one of the meanings of the Latin word <i>fucus</i> is "red paint".
/
/Algae of the |FRAME: TAX-3009| order produce fucose-rich polysaccahrides known as |FRAME: Fucoidans fucoidans|. However, fucose is a common sugar, found in <i>N</i>-linked glycans on the mammalian, insect and plant cell surface, in many bacterial glycans, and in other biomolecules.
/
/Most of the fucose found in biology is in the |FRAME: L-fucoses "L conformation"|, and the use of |FRAME: D-Fucoses| is rather rare (for example in some |FRAME: Cardenolide-Glycosides "cardenolide glycosides"|).
/
/Note that fucose is a reducing sugar that exists in solution in multiple configurations. The open-chain structure shown here is provided only as a schematic illustration of chirality. Consult the appropriate class instances for information on specific ring structures and their anomeric configuration.

COMMENT - This compound class stands for generic and unspecified lipopolysaccharides. The structure shown here is intended to provide a general overview and does not describe a lipopolysaccharide from a specific species.
/
/Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are a major component of the outer membrane of almost all Gram-negative bacteria. While they are protecting the membrane from certain kinds of chemical attacks, they also induce a strong response from animal immune systems. 
/
/Lipopolysaccharides can be conceptually divided into three parts: |FRAME: Lipid-A "lipid A"|, which anchors LPS into the membrane; the |FRAME: LPS-Core-Oligosaccharides "core oligosaccharide"|, which contributes to membrane stability; and the |FRAME: O-Antigens O-antigen|, which is a polysaccharide that extends away from the cell surface.
/
/Lipopolysaccharides that comprise all three regions are called |FRAME: Smooth-Form-LPS "smooth (S)-form LPS"|, while LPS lacking the <i>O</i>-antigen are named |FRAME: LOS "rough (R)-form LPS"| or lipooligosaccharide (LOS).
/
/Lipid A, which is common to most Gram negative bacteria, is the most toxic part. The core polysaccharide is genus specific, and contains unusual 7-carbon and 8-carbon sugars, and the <i>O</i>-antigen's side chains are variable in structure and toxicity.
/
/The <i>O</i>-antigen usually consists of about 20-40 repeated subunits.

COMMENT - Osmoprotectants or compatible solutes are small organic molecules with neutral charge and low toxicity that act as osmolytes and help organisms survive extreme osmotic stress. Most microorganisms capable of osmotic adaptation accumulate compatible solutes in response to increases in the levels of salts or sugars in the environment.

UNIQUE-ID - Acceptor
TYPES - Hydride-Acceptors
COMMON-NAME - an oxidized electron carrier
ABBREV-NAME - A
COMMENT - In general, an electron carrier is a chemical entity that can accept or donate electrons from/to another chemical entity.
/When accepting electrons, it acts as an "electron acceptor". By accepting the electrons, the acceptor is reduced, and thus prior to receiving the electrons the entity is called  "an oxidized electron acceptor" and after receiving them it is called "a reduced electron acceptor".
/
/Many reduced electron acceptors are able to transfer the electrons to other molecules, becoming oxidized in the process. Thus the distinction between an electron acceptor and an electron donor is often not determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some acceptors in biological reactions only accept electrons and do not transfer them further. Those are often known as "terminal electron acceptors".
/
/While in general every chemical reaction in which electrons are transferred includes an electron donor and an electron acceptor, several molecules are commonly used in metabolism solely for the purpose of electron transfer, and are referred to in biology as electron carriers. Different biological electron carriers differ in the number of electrons that they transfer and in their electron affinity.
/
/Some of the common biological electron carriers transfer only a single electron (e.g. |FRAME: Cytochromes cytochromes|, |FRAME: Blue-Copper-Proteins "blue copper proteins"|, and some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer two electrons (e.g. some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer a hydride ion ( e.g. |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP|), and some transfer two electrons and two protons (|FRAME: ETR-Quinones quinones|, |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|).
/In addition, a number of inorganic small molecules (e.g. oxygen, nitrate, iron (III), manganese (IV), sulfate) are often used as terminal electron acceptors.
/
/In many cases, purified enzymes can act <i>in vitro</i> using an artificial electron carrier, and their <i>in vivo</i> electron carrier is not known. This class of "unknown electron carriers" is used to describe such reactions, which are incompletely characterized.

UNIQUE-ID - Glycogens
TYPES - Alpha-6-branched-alpha-14-glucans
COMMON-NAME - a glycogen
COMMENT - Glycogen is a highly branched glucose polymer found in archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes. It resembles plant-produced |FRAME: Starch starch| and is sometimes called "animal starch". Glycogen serves multiple functions, including energy reserve, osmotic regulation, blood glucose homeostasis, and pH maintenance. 
/
/Glycogen is formed of small chains of 8 to 12 glucose molecules linked together by &alpha; (1->4) bonds. These small chains, also known as |FRAME: Maltodextrins maltodextrins|, are in turn linked together by &alpha; (1->6) bonds. The &alpha;-1,4 linkages make up approximately 95% of the total molecule.  The &alpha;-1,6 branches accounts for 7&ndash;10% of the linkages and are evenly distributed within the glycogen particle.
/
/Since each chain (with the exception of the outer unbranched chains) supports two branches, glycogen particles grow spherically by adding tiers (a tier corresponds to the spherical space separating two consecutive branches from all chains located at similar distance from the center of the particle).
/
/Two structural levels of glycogen particles have been reported, which are tightly associated with their physiological functions: small quasi-spherical &beta; particles, as found in muscle cells, and large rosette-shaped &alpha; particles, as found in liver cells. The diameter of &beta; particles normally range from 10 to 50 nm, with an average at around 20&mdash;30 nm. The &beta; particles can stick together to form large &alpha; particles with diameters up to
/300 nm |CITS: [20196533][31244022][33996916]|. Two types of &alpha; particles have been observed: fragile and dense particles, which comprise large and dense &beta; particles with long average chain length, and stable light particles, which comprise smaller, compact &beta; particles with short average chain length |CITS: [31244022]|.
/
/Mathematical modelling predicts a maximal size for the &beta; particle beyond which further growth is impossible, as there would not be sufficient space for interaction of the chains with the catalytic sites of glycogen metabolism enzymes. The predicted upper limit is a particle consisting of 12 tiers corresponding to a 42 nm maximal diameter and including about 55,000 glucose residues. 36% of this total number rests in the outer (unbranched) shell and is thus readily accessible to glycogen catabolism without the need for debranching |CITS: [12179957]|.
/
/Although glycogen and starch are two distinct physical states of the same type of storage polysaccharide, starch is solid semi-crystalline while glycogen particles are entirely hydrosoluble |CITS: [21220783]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: NADHX| is a hydrated form of |FRAME: NADH|, where the hydroxyl group is attached at position 6 of the nicotinamide moiety.
/
/Studies in the 1950s have shown that |FRAME: EC-1.2.1.12|, slowly catalyzes the formation of NADHX from NADH |CITS: [Rafter54]|. The equilibrium of this hydration reaction is in favor (100/1) of the hydrated form |CITS: [3061454]|, making the reaction virtually irreversible.
/
/NADHX and NADPHX are inhibitors of several dehydrogenases |CITS: [ 9851831]| and it is thus important to eliminate them. Reconversion of NADHX to NADH is catalyzed by an |FRAME: ENSG00000153481-MONOMER "ATP-dependent dehydratase"| |CITS:[239637][21994945]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Menaquinols
TYPES - ETR-Quinols
COMMON-NAME - a menaquinol
ABBREV-NAME - MQH<sub>2</sub>
COMMENT - Menaquinols are the reduced form of |FRAME: Menaquinones "menaquinones"|.
/
/Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are isoprenoid quinones of the naphthalene series, and are constituents of bacterial plasma membranes, where they play important roles in electron transfer and oxidative phosphorylation. Menaquinones are the most widespread respiratory quinones in biological systems |CITS: [Fujimoto12]|. Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are named MK-<i>n</i> or DMK-<i>n</i>, respectively, where the <i>n</i> refers to the number of prenyl units present in the side chain. The most common length of the side chain in bacteria is 8, although minor amounts of MK-1 through MK-14 have been found |CITS: [7022156]|.
/
/Many bacteria and archaea have |FRAME: Dihydromenaquinones "dehydrogenated menaquinones"|, which are named MK-<i>n</i>(H<sub>2</sub>). The degree and location of dehydrogenation depends on the species. Some organisms have menaquinones with modifications of the head group, for example |FRAME: TAX-2302| possess both |FRAME: CPD-15875 thermoplasmaquinones| (TPQ), which contains an extra methyl group, and |FRAME: CPD-15876 methionaquinones| (MTK), which contains a methylthio group |CITS: [11157962]|.
/
/Menaquinones are also known as vitamin K<sub>2</sub>. Vitamin K is a name given to a group of derivatives  of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone that are required by mammals for the posttranslational modification of certain proteins, mostly involved in blood coagulation. These compounds, while essential for mammals, are not synthesized by them, and are thus considered vitamins.
/
/The natural forms of the vitamin are vitamin K<sub>1</sub> (|FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE|) and vitamin K<sub>2</sub> (|FRAME: Menaquinones "menaquinone"|). Since menaquinones produced by different organisms have different tail lengths there are many variations of vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, usually specified based on the number of carbons in their tails, such as in Vitamin K<sub>2</sub>(45).

ATOM-CHARGES - (45 -1)

COMMENT - Many enzymes depend on the sulfo-form of molybdenum cofactor (MoCo). The so called maturation of MoCo involves the addition of sulfur to the Mo center, replacing an oxo group. In eukaryotes this reaction is catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-2.8.1.9| (e.g. the plant ABA3) |CITS: [11553608][15561708]|. However, prokaryotes do not have such an enzyme. In prokaryotes MoCo first binds to a chaperone (such as XdhC) before it is sulfurylated by |FRAME: EC-2.8.1.7|. Many of the prokaryotic molybdoenzymes have a specific chaperone |CITS: [23201473]|. The chaperones interact with the desulfurase, so that MoCo is sulfurated while it is still bound to the chaperone and before the insertion into the target protein. Binding to the chaperone stabilizes the sulfurated form of MoCo. Once sulfurylated, the chaperone transfer the cofactor to its target protein |CITS: [17649978]|.

COMMENT - 1,2-Propanediol (1,2-PDO) occurs in two stereoisomers - |FRAME: PROPANE-1-2-DIOL| and |FRAME: CPD-8891|. Both forms are produced by certain organisms. For example, during the catabolism of 6-deoxyhexoses |CITS: [Suzuki68][16346466]| or during the fermentation of glucose via methylglyoxal |CITS: [Tran-Din85][Cameron86]|. 
/
/1,2-PDO is a bulk industrial chemical with a global demand of around 1.36 million tons/year |CITS: [Shelley07]|. It is widely used in the production of unsaturated polyester resin and as a nontoxic replacement of ethylene glycol in deicer and antifreeze products. Current commercial production of 1,2-PDO is mainly by a synthetic process that results in a racemic mixture.

UNIQUE-ID - Androgens
TYPES - Steroid-Hormones
COMMON-NAME - an androgen
COMMENT - Androgens are steroid hormones that stimulate or control the development and maintenance of male characteristics in vertebrates, including the activity of the accessory male sex organs and development of male secondary sex characteristics, by binding to androgen receptors. Androgens are also produced by females, and are the precursors to estrogens. Present in lower concentrations than in males, androgens contribute to libido and sexual arousal in females.
/
/Important androgens include |FRAME: TESTOSTERONE|, |FRAME: 17-BETA-HYDROXY-5ALPHA-ANDROSTAN-3-O| (DHT) and |FRAME: ANDROST4ENE androstenedione|. |FRAME: TESTOSTERONE Testosterone| is the major androgen in adult males, while DHT plays a crucial role in utero, causing differentiation of the penis, scrotum and prostate. In adulthood DHT contributes to balding, prostate growth, and sebaceous gland activity.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Arabinoses Arabinose| is an aldopentose - a monosaccharide containing five carbon atoms. Unlike many other aldoses, which are more abundant in nature as the "D"-form, |FRAME: L-ARABINOSE| is far more common in nature than |FRAME: D-ARABINOSE|. Free |FRAME: L-ARABINOSE| rarely exists in the nature (though it has been found in the core of coniferous trees |CITS: [Pingman57]|). However, it is widely distributed as a component of complex nonstarch polysaccharides in plant cell walls, including many plants common in the human diet such as maize, wheat, rye, rice, sugar beets, and plant gums, and in bacterial polysaccharides. 
/
/L-arabinose has many biomedical and health effects, especially intestinal sucrase inhibition effect |CITS: [8931641]|. In recent years it has been used as a low-caloric sweetener, with approximately 50% of the sweetness of sucrose |CITS: [Hu18]|.

COMMENT - Phosphatidylserine (PS) is a phospholipid found in the cell membrane. It faces the cytosolic (inner) side of the cell membrane, and is held in place by the enzyme flippase. When a cell undergoes apoptosis, phospholipid scramblase catalyzes the rapid exchange of phosphatidylserine between the two sides. When PS flips to the extracellular (outer) surface, it acts as a signal for macrophages to engulf the cells |CITS: [7595231]|. Phosphatidylserine also plays an important role in blood coagulation |CITS: [12814644]|.
/
/In bacteria PS is biosynthesized by condensing |FRAME: SER| with |FRAME: CDPDIACYLGLYCEROL| by |FRAME: EC-2.7.8.8|. In animalsPS is only produced by base-exchange reactions with phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-2.7.8.29|.

UNIQUE-ID - Inositols
TYPES - Cyclitols
COMMON-NAME - an inositol
CHEMICAL-FORMULA - (C 6)
CHEMICAL-FORMULA - (H 12)
CHEMICAL-FORMULA - (O 6)
COMMENT - |FRAME: Inositols Inositol| is the generic name for 1,2,3,4,5,6-cyclohexanehexol. Epimerization of the six hydroxyl groups results in nine stereoisomers. Among the isomers, |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| is the most abundant in nature and it is an essential compound in eukaryotic cell membranes as a phosphatidylinositol moiety, which plays an important role in signal transduction. Some other forms, such as |FRAME: CPD-8050|, are also found in nature, although they are less abundant.
/
/Nomenclature of cyclitols can be quite confusing. Two alternative naming schemes are possible for inositol compounds since carbon-1 could be assigned to either of two enantiotopic carbons. The two methods result in 1D-stereochemistry and 1L-stereochemistry based names. If carbon-1 is placed at the top of the molecule, L-numbering proceeds clockwise, while D-numbering proceeds counter-clockwise. Both the 1D or 1L designations can be employed currently. However, the symbol Ins implies myo-inositol with D- numbering.
/
/Additional information on the nomenclature of <i>myo</i>-inositol compounds can be found in the 1973 document <A href="http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1974/pdf/3701x0283.pdf">Nomenclature of cyclitols</A> by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry (NC-IUB), and the 1988 publication <A href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbcs/iupac/cyclitol/myo.html">Numbering of atoms in <i>myo</i>-inositol</A>, published by the same body, whose aim was to relax some of the rules specified in the 1973 publication.
/
/To aid in following the transformations in inositol compounds in pathways, the structures of inositol stereoisomers in MetaCyc have been formatted to show carbon 1 at the top of the ring, with numbering proceeding clockwise. An exception is the structure of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL|, which is presented with carbon 3 at the top and counter-clockwise numbering. The reason is that carbon 3 of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| (which is based on L-numbering) matches the carbon-1 of 1D numbering, which is used for the various phosphorylated and otherwise modified forms, and by presenting the molecule in this way, it is much easier to show structural relationships in reactions and pathways (see for example |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL-1-KINASE-RXN "EC 2.7.1.64"|).

COMMENT - Lactate, or 2-hydroxypropanoate, was discovered in 1780 by the Swedish chemist Scheele, who isolated it from sour milk. It is the simplest hydroxycarboxylic acid and exists as 2 stereoisomers, |FRAME: L-LACTATE| and |FRAME: D-LACTATE|. Lactate has a pK of 3.86 and exists at a lactate ion:|FRAME: CPD-24845| ratio of 3000:1 at physiological pH |CITS: [15987839]|.
/
/|FRAME: L-LACTATE| has more versatile applications in food, pharmaceutical, textile, and chemical industries than |FRAME: D-LACTATE|. It is also an indispensable monomer for the synthesis of poly-Ll-lactic acid, a bio-degradable polymer.

UNIQUE-ID - Cobalamins

COMMON-NAME - a <i>Co</i>&alpha;-[&alpha;-(5,6-dimethylbenzimidazolyl)]-cobamide
COMMENT - |FRAME: Cobamides "A cobamide"| is a corrinoid molecule based on the structure of |FRAME: CPD-20843|, a cobalt-corrinoid hexaamide that is formed from |FRAME: COBINAMIDE| by the attachment of an &alpha;-D-ribofuranose 3-phosphate residue at the 2 position of the aminopropanol chain.
/
/Active forms of cobamides, such as the B12 vitamins, contain upper (&beta;) and lower (&alpha;) ligands. The most common type of cobamides, |FRAME: Cobalamins cobalamin|, contains |FRAME: DIMETHYLBENZIMIDAZOLE| as the lower ligand.
/
/Since the cobalamin term does not specify the upper axial ligand, it includes several compounds that differ in their upper axial ligand. The functional forms of cobalamin, |FRAME:CPD-9037| and |FRAME:ADENOSYLCOBALAMIN|, include either a methyl group or an 5'-deoxyadenosyl group as their upper axial ligand, respectively. The form of cobalamin known as vitamin B12 is the artificially-made |FRAME: CPD-315|, which is converted to an active form in the human body upon ingestion.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Amine-Donors "An amino group donor"| is a compound that can donate an amino group to another compound in a reaction catalyzed by enzymes that belong to the |FRAME: EC-2.6.1 transaminase group"| (often called aminotransferases).
/Prior to donating the amino group the compound is |FRAME: Aminated-Amine-Donors| and after donating it the compound is |FRAME: Deaminated-Amine-Donors|.
/
/Since tranmination reactions are reversible, the distinction between an amino group donor and an amino group acceptor is not determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some compounds, such as |FRAME: GLT| and |FRAME: L-ALPHA-ALANINE|, are often used as amino group donors by the aminotransferases in reactions that are physiologically unidirectional.
/
/This particular entry is used when the identity of the amino group donor (or acceptor) is not known or cannot be defined.

UNIQUE-ID - Opines
TYPES - Organooxygen-Compounds
COMMON-NAME - an opine
COMMENT - |FRAME: Opines Opines| are a large family of low molecular weight compounds. The vast majority of opines are secondary amine derivatives resulting from the reduction of the imine formed by condensation of an amino acid with either a keto acid or a sugar. Opines from the |FRAME: CPD-308| family are formed when |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE| serves as the keto substrate in the condensation reaction, while those of the |FRAME: CPD-309| family are formed when |FRAME: PYRUVATE| is involved in the condensation reaction. Opines of the |FRAME: CPD-15773| and |FRAME: CPD-26410| families are formed by the condensation of an amino acid with a sugar.
/
/A small, separate class of opines is the |FRAME: Agrocinopines agrocinopines|, which are sugar-phosphodiesters (e.g., |FRAME: CPD-15774|, which is a phosphodiester of sucrose and L-arabinose).
/
/While opines are found in marine invertebrates, fungi, higher plants and mammals, they are most commonly found in plant crown gall tumors or hairy root tumors, where they are produced by bacteria of the genera |FRAME: TAX-357| and |FRAME: TAX-379|, respectively. However, the first opine to be identified (in 1927), octopine, was isolated from an octopus muscle, hence its name, which was later extended for naming the opine family.
/
/Biosynthesis of opines in crown gall tumors is performed by enzymes encoded by genes contained in T-DNA (transfer DNA), which is part of the Ti plasmid (in |FRAME: TAX-357|) or Ri plasmid (in |FRAME: TAX-379|). The plasmids are inserted by the bacteria into the plant genome, where they are integrated and expressed. Those opines are used by the bacteria as energy, carbon and nitrogen sources. Each strain of |FRAME: TAX-357| and |FRAME: TAX-379| induces and catabolizes a specific set of opines, determined by the specific Ti or Ri plasmid they possess, and Ti-plasmids are classified as nopaline-type, octopine-type, agropine-type, vitopine-type, succinamopine-type, and chrysopine-type |CITS: [31386108]|. Over 30 different opines have been described.

UNIQUE-ID - Amine-Donors

COMMON-NAME - an amino group acceptor
COMMENT - |FRAME: Amine-Donors "An amino group donor"| is a compound that can donate an amino group to another compound in a reaction catalyzed by enzymes that belong to the |FRAME: EC-2.6.1 transaminase group"| (often called aminotransferases).
/Prior to donating the amino group the compound is |FRAME: Aminated-Amine-Donors| and after donating it the compound is |FRAME: Deaminated-Amine-Donors|.
/
/Since tranmination reactions are reversible, the distinction between an amino group donor and an amino group acceptor is not determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some compounds, such as |FRAME: GLT| and |FRAME: L-ALPHA-ALANINE|, are often used as amino group donors by the aminotransferases in reactions that are physiologically unidirectional.
/
/This particular entry is used when the identity of the amino group donor (or acceptor) is not known or cannot be defined.

UNIQUE-ID - FLAVIN
TYPES - Benzopteridines
COMMON-NAME - a flavin
COMMENT - A |FRAME: FLAVIN flavin| is a chemical moiety found in the compounds |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|, both important redox cofactors involved in many important reactions in metabolism.
/
/Flavin can exist in two different redox states, which it converts between by accepting or donating electrons. The |FRAME: Oxidized-Flavins "fully oxidized form"| (or quinone form) accepts two electrons and two protons to become the |FRAME: Reduced-Flavins "fully reduced form"| (hydroquinone form). The reduced form can be oxidized to a semireduced form (semiquinone) by donating one electron and one proton. A second oxidation results in restoring the initial quinone form.
/
/The conjugated ring system of fully oxidized flavin confers a bright yellow color, and its name is derived from <i>flavus</i>, Latin for yellow.
/
/Flavins are synthesized from |FRAME: GTP| in the form of |FRAME: RIBOFLAVIN|, which is later modified into |FRAME: FMN| or |FRAME: FAD|. Since mammals cannot synthesize |FRAME: RIBOFLAVIN|, it is an essential vitamin for them.

CHEMICAL-FORMULA - (C 6)

COMMENT - D-Glucose is an extremely abundant monosaccharide that is used as an energy source in most organisms, from bacteria to humans. In humans D-glucose is the key source of energy, through aerobic respiration, but other organisms can also metabolize glucose by anaerobic respiration and fermentation.
/
/D-Glucose is also one of the main products of photosynthesis, and is used as a precursor for the synthesis of several important substances, such as cellulose and chitin. Many organisms store glucose as an energy and carbon reserve in the form of polymers such as  starch and glycogen.
/
/In addition, D-glucose is often added onto certain proteins and lipids through glycosylation, which is often critical for their functioning.
/
/Each aldopentose or aldohexose exists as a mixture of at least six compounds: the aldehyde, the hydrated aldehyde
/(gem-diol), the two pyranoses, and the two furanoses. The open-chain structure shown here is provided only as a schematic illustration of chirality. Consult the appropriate class instances for information on specific ring structures and their anomeric configuration. At 37&deg;C the distribution of the different glucose tautomers is as follows |CITS: [Maple87]|:

COMMENT - The ubiquinones are a group of lipid-soluble benzoquinones involved in electron transport. Their structures
/have a variable length side chain, which consists of one to twelve mono-unsaturated
/<I>trans</I>-isoprenoids units, with ten units being the most common in animals.
/|FRAME: TAX-4932| has 6 units, |FRAME: TAX-71421| has 7, |FRAME: TAX-83333| has 8, |FRAME: TAX-1142|
/has 9, |FRAME: TAX-9606| has 10, and |FRAME: TAX-1270| has an 11 unit form |CITS: [16233343]|.
/
/The terms ubiquinone/ubiquinol refer to the oxidized/reduced forms, and are often used interchangeably.
/The forms are readily interconvertable. 
/
/Ubiquinone is also known as coenzyme Q, or just Q. The names are often followed by the number of the prenoid units in the side chain (e.g. Q-8), or the number of carbons in the chain. For example, the name Q-8 may be substituted with ubiiquinone(40). Since these carbons occur in repeating units of five, these number are multiples of 5.

COMMON-NAME - a vitamin B6
COMMENT - |FRAME: Vitamins-B6 Vitamin B6| is a group term for |FRAME:PYRIDOXAL| (PL), |FRAME:PYRIDOXINE| (PN), |FRAME:PYRIDOXAMINE| (PM) and their 5'-phosphorylated derivatives |FRAME:PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE| (PLP), |FRAME:PYRIDOXINE-5P| (PNP) and |FRAME:PYRIDOXAMINE-5P| (PMP), which are also referred to as vitamers.
/
/Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) is the biochemically active form, and is an essential cofactor in all living systems |CITS: [7748903]|. It plays an important role in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism and has been implicated in singlet oxygen resistance |CITS: [10687384]|.
/
/Most bacteria, archaea, fungi, and plants synthesize PLP in a single reaction, as described in |FRAME: PWY-6466|, although some bacteria, such as <i>E. coli</i>, use a longer, more complex pathway (|FRAME: PYRIDOXSYN-PWY|) |CITS: [9696782][12896974]|. Animals do not synthesize this compound, making it an essential nutrient in their diet.
/
/PLP is an essential cofactor of numerous metabolic enzymes, predominantly in amino acid metabolism. It is one of the most versatile cofactors and participates in transamination, decarboxylation, racemization, C&alpha;-C&beta; cleavage and &alpha;-&beta; elimination reactions. In humans this vitamin has a role in numerous functions ranging from modulation of hormone function to potent antioxidant activity.

COMMENT - A semiquinone is a free radical resulting from the removal of one hydrogen atom with its electron during the process of dehydrogenation of |FRAME: Reduced-Quinones| to |FRAME: Quinones| or, alternatively, the addition of a single hydrogen atom to |FRAME: Quinones|.
/
/Quinones are organic compounds derived from aromatic compounds, with two carbonyl groups incorporated into the ring structure with rearrangement of the double bonds where necessary. Quinones are conjugated but not aromatic.
/
/A classic example of a quinone is |FRAME: P-BENZOQUINONE|. Quinones are commonly named with a prefix that indicates the parent aromatic hydrocarbon (for example, "benzo-" for benzene, "naphtho-" for naphthalene, and "anthra-" for anthracene) with a "-quinone" suffix.
/
/Several types of quinones serve as electron acceptors in electron transport chains. Quinones can carry two electrons, and when fully reduced they are referred to as |FRAME: Reduced-Quinones quinols|. The addition of a single H atom to a quinone results in formation of a free radical called |FRAME: Semiquinones|.
/
/Many quinone derivatives often have other biological activities, such as |FRAME: CPD-11501 "vitamin K"|.

UNIQUE-ID - Monounsaturated-fatty-acids

COMMON-NAME - a monounsaturated fatty acid
ATOM-CHARGES - (1 -1)
COMMENT - |FRAME: Fatty-Acids "A fatty acid"| is a carboxylic acid with a long unbranched aliphatic tail.
/Even though fatty acids derived from natural fats and oils, such as |FRAME:CPD-195|, are usually at least 8 carbon atoms long, carboxylic acids as short as |FRAME:BUTYRIC_ACID| (4 carbon atoms) are considered to be fatty acids.
/
/When a fatty acid contains only single bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Saturated-Fatty-Acids|. When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|. If it contains a double bond in the <i>trans</i> configuration, it is often referred to as a <i>trans</i> fatty acid. Most fatty acids in the <i>trans</i> configuration are not found in nature and are the result of human processing.
/
/<b>About nomenclature</b>: Several nomenclatures are used for unsaturated fatty acids, and are not complementary. Systematic names (or IUPAC names) begin counting the carbon atoms from the carboxylic acid end, and the double bonds are labelled with <i>cis</i>/<i>trans</i> or E/Z notation, e.g. 8<i>E</i>,10<i>E</i>,12<i>Z</i>-octadecatrienoate. However, unsaturated fatty acids are often described using the omega nomenclature, which begins counting the carbon atoms from the terminal methyl carbon (designated as <i>n</i> or &omega;).
/In addition, unsaturated fatty acids are often referred to by trivial names, or by the "lipid number" as in 18:3, where 18 is the number of carbons, and 3 is the number of double bonds. This notation is ambiguous, as it does not specify the location of the double bonds.

COMMON-NAME - all folates
COMMENT - While folic acid is the name given to a particular compound (see |FRAME: CPD-12826|), it is also the name given to a group of compounds based on the |FRAME: PTEROATE| skeleton and conjugated with one or more molecules of |FRAME: GLT|. Many of these compounds are also known as vitamin B9.
/
/Folic acid on its own is not biologically active, and needs to be converted to tetrahydrofolate and other active derivatives (via dihydrofolate). The biologically active forms are essential cofactors that facilitate the transfer of one-carbon units from donor molecules into important biosynthetic pathways leading to methionine, purine, and pyrimidine biosynthesis. 
/Folates also mediate the interconversion of serine and glycine, play a role in histidine catabolism |CITS: [11001804]|, and in plants are also involved in photorespiration, amino acid metabolism and chloroplastic protein biosynthesis |CITS: [11960743][12644692]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Fatty-Acids
TYPES - Carboxylates
COMMON-NAME - a fatty acid
ATOM-CHARGES - (2 -1)
COMMENT - The term "fatty acid" was originally coined to describe aliphatic monocarboxylic acids derived from or contained in esterified form in an animal or vegetable fat, oil or wax. However, over the years the term has been expanded to refer to additional, shorter monocarboxylic acids with an aliphatic tail such as |FRAME: PROPIONATE| and |FRAME: BUTYRIC_ACID| (but not the shorter |FRAME: FORMATE| and |FRAME: ACET|).
/
/The length of a fatty acid is determined by the length of the longest carbon chain, including the carbon of the carboxy group. Common natural fatty acids usually have an even number of carbons in the longest chain and can be either saturated or unsaturated. In many organisms they are often modified by branching, hydroxylation, methylation, epoxidation and other types of modifications.
/
/Inside living cells fatty acids are rarely found in free form. They are usually bound to coenzyme A or acyl-carrier proteins, or form part of |FRAME: Triacylglycerides triglycerides|, |FRAME: Phospholipids phospholipids|, |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides lipopolysaccharides|, and |FRAME: Cholesterol-esters cholesterol esters|.
/
/Many enzymes that act on fatty acids, as well as the corresponding |FRAME: Fatty-Acyl-CoAs "fatty acyl-CoAs"|, |FRAME: Fatty-Alcohols alcohols|, and |FRAME: Fatty-Aldehydes aldehydes|, have evolved to recognize substrates with a limited range of chain lengths. To classify these enzymes, it is helpful to divide the substrates into smaller groups based on their chain length. The following subgroups have been defined:
/
/|FRAME: Short-chain-fatty-acids "Short-chain fatty acids"| (SCFA) have 3-5 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Medium-chain-fatty-acids "Medium-chain fatty acids"| (MCFA) have 6-12 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Long-Chain-Fatty-Acids "Long-chain fatty acids"| (LCFA) have 13-22 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Very-long-chain-fatty-acids "Very-long-chain fatty acids"| (VLCFA) have 23-27 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Ultra-long-chain-fatty-acids "Ultra-long-chain fatty acids"| (ULCFA) have more than 27 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/Most of the natural fatty acids have an even number of carbon atoms, since their biosynthesis involves the addition of two-carbon-atom units. When a fatty acid contains only single bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Saturated-Fatty-Acids|. When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|. If it contains a double bond in the <i>trans</i> configuration, it is often referred to as a <i>trans</i> fatty acid. Most fatty acids in the <i>trans</i> configuration are not found in nature and are the result of human processing.

COMMENT - 'Heme' is usually understood as any tetrapyrrolic chelate of iron. The terms 'ferroheme' and 'ferriheme' refer to the Fe(II) and Fe(III) oxidation states in heme (even though Fe(IV) is found as a catalytic intermediate in some systems).
/
/Heme <i>a</i> was first isolated in 1951 and shown to be the active component of the integral membrane metalloprotein |FRAME: EC-7.1.1.9| |CITS: [Warburg51]|. The correct structure was published in 1975 |CITS: [170266]|.
/
/The immediate product of the heme biosynthesis pathways (by ferro-chelation of |FRAME: PROTOPORPHYRIN_IX|) is |FRAME: Heme-b "heme <i>b</i>"|, whose |FRAME: PROTOHEME "ferrous form"| is known as protoheme IX. |FRAME: HEME_A "Heme <i>a</i>"| differs from heme <i>b</i> in that a methyl side chain at ring position 8 is oxidized to a formyl group, and a hydroxyethylfarnesyl chain is attached to the vinyl side chain at ring position 2. It is synthesized from |FRAME: Heme-b| via |FRAME: HEME_O|, which lacks the formyl group but contains the hydroxyethylfarnesyl chain, and a short-lived |FRAME: Heme_I| intermediate |CITS: [7885224]|.
/
/|FRAME: HEME_A "Heme <i>a</i>"| is part of |FRAME: A-type-Cytochromes "<i>a</i>-type cytochromes"|. Like in |FRAME: Cytochromes-B "<i>b</i>-type cytochromes"|, heme <i>a</i> is often attached to the apoprotein through a coordinate bond between the heme iron and a conserved amino acid side-chain. Heme <i>a</i> is found exclusively in respiratory oxidases of mitochondria and aerobic bacteria, and all known heme <i>a</i>-containing oxidases belong to the hemecopper superfamily of terminal oxidases |CITS: [808315]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Steroids

TYPES - Organic-Polycyclic-Compounds
COMMON-NAME - a steroid
COMMENT - Steroids are compounds possessing the skeleton of cyclopenta[<i>a</i>]phenanthrene or a skeleton derived
/therefrom by one or more bond scissions or ring expansions or contractions. Methyl groups are normally present
/at C-10 and C-13. An alkyl side chain may also be present at C-17.
/
/Steroids are abundant in the environment. Large amounts of steroids and their derivatives are synthesized by eukaryotes, and these molecules play very important and diverse roles and include hormones, detergents that facilitate the absorption of lipids by the intestine, and membrane constituents. Some of them, |FRAME: CHOLESTEROL| and related compounds, are ubiquitous as membrane constituent of eukaryotes (for instance, up to 10% of the dry mass of yeast is |FRAME: ERGOSTEROL|) and as the precursors of all steroid hormones, vitamin D, and the bile acids.
/
/Interestingly, with exception of methane-oxidizing bacteria that contain relatively large amounts of sterols, sterols are absent from most prokaryotes. However, many bacterial membranes contain |FRAME: Hopanoids hopanoids|, which are similar pentacyclic sterol-like molecules |CITS: [18039763]|.

UNIQUE-ID - THF-GLU-N
TYPES - All-Folates
TYPES - Demethylated-methyl-acceptors
COMMON-NAME - a tetrahydrofolate
ATOM-CHARGES - (31 -1)
COMMENT - |FRAME: THF-GLU-N Tetrahydrofolate| (vitamin B9) and its derivatives, commonly termed folates, are required in a variety of reactions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, where they act as carriers of one-carbon units in various oxidation states. These one-carbon units are utilized in the biosynthesis of various cellular components, including glycine, methionine, formylmethionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides.
/
/During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme |FRAME: EC-6.3.2.12|, adds a glutamate residue to |FRAME: 7-8-DIHYDROPTEROATE|, resulting in |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE|, also known as H<sub>2</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>. This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:EC-1.5.1.3| (FolA) to |FRAME: THF| (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>, or tetrahydrofolate), which can be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|.
/
/Most folate molecules are modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming folate polyglutamates (or folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamates). The glutamate residues are added by an amide linkage to the &gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by peptidases or proteases, which are specific for &alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide bonds.
/
/The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives.
/
/The glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis |CITS: [10598551]|.
/
/This class stands for tetrahydrofolates with an unspecified number of glutamate residues.

COMMENT - Siderophores are small, high-affinity iron chelating compounds usually produced and secreted by microorganisms. Once outside the cell, siderophores bind |FRAME: FE+3| with high affinity, and the iron-siderophore complexes are imported back into the cell by active-transport mechanisms.
/
/Siderophores are very common in pathogenic bacteria, since iron in the host organism is usually tightly bound to proteins, resulting in an extremely low concentration of free iron in the blood.
/
/Most siderophores belong to one of three major groups: the |FRAME: Catecholate-siderophores "catechols"|, |FRAME: Hydroxamate-siderophores "hydroxamates"| and |FRAME: Thiazoline-siderophores "thiazolines"|. 
/Some grasses are known to make siderophores as well. These |FRAME: Phytosiderophores "phytosiderophores"| are also known as mugineic acids.
/
/Catecholate siderophores are named based on a |FRAME: CATECHOL| element present in their structure (catecholate is the name of the anion form that is the conjugate base of catechol).

UNIQUE-ID - Menaquinones
TYPES - CPD-11501
TYPES - ETR-Quinones
COMMON-NAME - a menaquinone
ABBREV-NAME - MQ
COMMENT - Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are isoprenoid quinones of the naphthalene series, and are constituents of bacterial plasma membranes, where they play important roles in electron transfer and oxidative phosphorylation. Menaquinones are the most widespread respiratory quinones in biological systems |CITS: [Fujimoto12]|. Menaquinones and demethylmenaquinones are named MK-<i>n</i> or DMK-<i>n</i>, respectively, where the <i>n</i> refers to the number of prenyl units present in the side chain. The most common length of the side chain in bacteria is 8, although minor amounts of MK-1 through MK-14 have been found |CITS: [7022156]|.
/
/Many bacteria and archaea have |FRAME: Dihydromenaquinones "dehydrogenated menaquinones"|, which are named MK-<i>n</i>(H<sub>2</sub>). The degree and location of dehydrogenation depends on the species. Some organisms have menaquinones with modifications of the head group, for example |FRAME: TAX-2302| possess both |FRAME: CPD-15875 thermoplasmaquinones| (TPQ), which contains an extra methyl group, and |FRAME: CPD-15876 methionaquinones| (MTK), which contains a methylthio group |CITS: [11157962]|.
/
/Menaquinones are also known as vitamin K<sub>2</sub>. Vitamin K is a name given to a group of derivatives  of 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone that are required by mammals for the posttranslational modification of certain proteins, mostly involved in blood coagulation. These compounds, while essential for mammals, are not synthesized by them, and are thus considered vitamins.
/
/The natural forms of the vitamin are vitamin K<sub>1</sub> (|FRAME: 2-METHYL-3-PHYTYL-14-NAPHTHOQUINONE|) and vitamin K<sub>2</sub> (|FRAME: Menaquinones "menaquinone"|). Since menaquinones produced by different organisms have different tail lengths there are many variations of vitamin K<sub>2</sub>, usually specified based on the number of carbons in their tails, such as in Vitamin K<sub>2</sub>(45).
/
/The reduced form of menaquinone is called |FRAME: Menaquinols|.

COMMON-NAME - a [pyruvate dehydrogenase E2 protein] <i>N<sup>6</sup></i>-lipoyl-L-lysine
COMMENT - |FRAME: LIPOIC-ACID "Lipoate"| is an organosulfur compound that is used as an essential cofactor by many enzyme complexes. The functional group of lipoate is a ditholane ring, which is a cyclic disulfide.
/
/The enzyme complexes that require lipoate have a dedicated |FRAME: Lipoyl-Protein "lipoyl domain"|, and lipoate is actually produced on this domain. The precursor |FRAME: CPD-195| molecule is first attached to a specific |FRAME: LYS| residue within the lipoyl domain (producing |FRAME: Octanoylated-domains|), and is then converted to lipoate by the enzyme |FRAME: EC-2.8.1.8|, resulting in |FRAME: Lipoyl-Protein-N6-lipoyllysine|.
/
/|FRAME: CPLX0-782 "Lipoate synthase"| not only catalyzes the reaction, but is also the source of the two sulfur atoms (see several pathway variants under |FRAME: Lipoate-Biosynthesis|).

UNIQUE-ID - Aromatics
TYPES - Cyclic-Compounds
COMMON-NAME - an aromatic compound
COMMENT - An aromatic compound contains one or more aromatic rings (an aromatic ring is a planar ring in which every atom must have an occupied p orbital, which overlaps with p orbitals on either side). The pi orbitals of the ring's atoms form a conjugated system and are in resonance, giving increased stability compared to saturated compounds having a similar structure. As a result aromatic rings are very stable and do not break apart easily. The least complex aromatic hydrocarbon is benzene.
/
/The name stems from a time when compounds were characterized by their smell rather than their chemical structure.
/
/Similar structures in which at least one of the ring's carbon atoms  is replaced by one of the heteroatoms oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur, are called heteroarenes.

COMMENT - This class holds |FRAME: Quinones quinones| that are involved in electron transfer within membranes.
/
/Quinones are organic compounds derived from aromatic compound, with two carbonyl groups incorporated into the ring structure with rearrangement of the double bonds where necessary. A classic example of a quinone is |FRAME: P-BENZOQUINONE|. Quinones are commonly named with a prefix that indicates the parent aromatic hydrocarbon (for example, "benzo-" for benzene, "naphtho-" for naphthalene, and "anthra-" for anthracene) with a "-quinone" suffix.
/
/Several types of quinones serve as electron acceptors in electron transport chains. Quinones can carry two electrons, and when fully reduced they are referred to as |FRAME: Reduced-Quinones quinols|. The addition of a single H atom to a quinone results in formation of a free radical called |FRAME: Semiquinones|.
/
/Many quinone derivatives often have other biological activities, such as |FRAME: CPD-11501 "vitamin K"|.

ATOM-CHARGES - (37 -1)

ATOM-CHARGES - (27 1)
COMMENT - |FRAME: NAD-P-OR-NOP| is a class of compounds including the instances |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP|.
/
/|FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP| are dinucleotides containing one |FRAME: NIACINAMIDE| base and one |FRAME: ADENINE| base. Each nucleotide is connected to a ribose sugar at position 1, and the two riboses are connected at their 5 position via a diphosphate. The only difference between the two is that in NADP there is an additional phosphate group at the 2' position of the ribose that carries the adenine moiety.
/
/These molecules are biological carriers of reductive equivalents (i.e. high potential electrons). They are often referred to as coenzymes, although in most of their reactions they function as cosubstrates rather than true coenzymes.
/
/The most common function of |FRAME: NAD| is to accept two electrons and a proton (a hydride ion) from a substrate that is being oxidized. This reduction converts |FRAME: NAD| to |FRAME: NADH|, the reduced form. NADH then diffuses or is transported to a terminal oxidase, where the electrons are passed on, regenerating the oxidized form.
/
/|FRAME: NADPH|, on the other hand, is mostly involved in biosynthetic reactions, where it serves as an electron donor. NADPH is formed by reduction of |FRAME: NADP|, which occurs by different mechanisms in different types of organisms. In photosynthetic organisms |FRAME: NADP| is reduced by |FRAME: CPLX-84|. In heterotrophic organisms it is reduced by central metabolism processes such as the pentose phosphate pathway (see |FRAME: OXIDATIVEPENT-PWY|).

UNIQUE-ID - CPD-25639
TYPES - Glycolipids
COMMON-NAME - a mannosylerythritol lipid
COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD-25639 "Mannosylerythritol lipids"| (MELs) are amphiphilic glycolipids that display high surface activity and act as biodetergents (biosurfactants). The compounds are produced by yeast strains that belong to the |FRAME: TAX-5269| and |FRAME: TAX-63261| genera. They show excellent surface-active properties and versatile biochemical actions. The compounds were first described in 1956 from an |FRAME: TAX-5269| species |CITS: [13276861]|. However, the most common MEL producing species are members of the |FRAME: TAX-63261| genus, such as |FRAME: TAX-84753|, |FRAME: TAX-84754|, |FRAME: TAX-84752|, and |FRAME: TAX-203536| |CITS: [25723622]|.
/
/The lipids are acylated at positions O-2' and O-3' by a range of fatty acyl residues. In |FRAME: TAX-5270| the fatty acid at O-2' ranges from C2 to C6, while that at O-3' ranges from C12 to C16. In addition, MELs differ in their acetylation status. Four general types are produced differing in the acetylation of positions O-4' and O-6'. Mel-D has no acetylation, MEL-B is acetylated only at the O-6' position, MEL-C is acetylated only at the O-4' position, and MEL-A is acetylated at both positions |CITS: [Kitamoto90a][Kitamoto90][10570818][17898510]|. 
/
/The biological function of MELs is still unknown, but they are of growing biotechnological interest as a sustainable alternative for chemical surfactants |CITS: [18585066][22901730]|.

ATOM-CHARGES - (18 1)
COMMENT - The peptide moiety of peptidoglycan, which is bound through its N terminus to the carboxyl group of muramate and contains L and D amino acids, reveals considerable variation. These peptides are synthesized as penetapeptides, but are often cleaved, resulting in a range in length of 2 to 5 amino acids. In addition, the peptide side-chain are often branched with additional amino acids. This compound class represnets the pentapeptide form.
/
/The amino acid linked directly to muramate is usually |FRAME:L-ALPHA-ALANINE|, but in some cases can be replaced by |FRAME: GLY| or |FRAME: SER| |CITS: [5777324][5965240][4385976][6029599][5704800][5469569][6033749]|.
/
/The most common amino acid in the second position is |FRAME: D-GLT|, but in some cases (in a few coryneform bacteria) it is hydroxylated to |FRAME: CPD-48| |CITS: [6072398]|. In some organisms the &alpha;-carboxyl group of |FRAME: D-GLT| is modified by amidation or substituted by |FRAME: GLY| |CITS: [5965232][6064598]|, by |FRAME: GLYCINAMIDE| |CITS: [Interschick70]|, or by |FRAME: CPD0-1578| |CITS: [4683671]|.
/
/The greatest variation occurs at position 3. The residue at this position is usually a diamino acid and is involved in cross-linking through the second amino group. The most common residue at this position is |FRAME: MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE|, which is present in probably all Gram-negative bacteria and in many other organisms, such as some species of bacilli, clostridia, lactobacilli, corynebacteria, propionibacteria, Actinomycetales, Myxobacteriales, Rickettsiae, and cyanobacteria |CITS: [410379][6131881]| (see |FRAME:PEPTIDOGLYCANSYN-PWY|).
/The second common residue at this position is |FRAME: LYS|, but other substituition have been documented, including |FRAME: L-ORNITHINE| |CITS: [4884715][14152785][6035494][6031807]|, |FRAME:LL-DIAMINOPIMELATE| |CITS: [14024243][13882624][13525638][11945321]|, |FRAME: CPD-7690| |CITS: [5870104]|, and |FRAME: 5-HYDROXY-L-LYSINE| |CITS: [16562051]|. In some cases the diamino acid in position 3 is not involved in cross linking. In these cases
/the residue in position 3 can be |FRAME: N-ACETYL-L-24-DIAMINOBUTANOATE|, as in the case of |FRAME: TAX-28447| |CITS: [5704800][5119774]|, or even a monoamino acid, such as |FRAME:L-ALPHA-ALANINE|, |FRAME: GLT| |CITS: [4259817]| or |FRAME: HOMO-SER| |CITS: [5119774][5119774 ][5469569]|.
/
/Position 4 and 5 are almost always occupied by |FRAME: D-ALA-D-ALA| di-peptide. In several species of enterococci and lactobacilli, the terminal |FRAME:D-ALANINE| is replaced by |FRAME:D-LACTATE| |CITS: [1503450]| or |FRAME:D-SERINE| |CITS: [8852545]|, which entails resistance to the glycopeptide antibiotic |FRAME: CPD-12245|.

TYPES - Protein-Modified-Amino-Acids
COMMON-NAME - an (<i>S</i>-diacyl-<i>sn</i>-glyceryl)-L-cysteinyl-[apolipoprotein]
ATOM-CHARGES - (9 1)
COMMENT - A prolipoprotein contains an N-terminal signal peptide. The protein is synthesized in the cytoplasm and then translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane. The signal peptide possesses positively charged amino acid residues in the N-terminal region and uncharged amino acids in the central hydrophobic region and contains a characteristic consensus sequence called the lipobox in the C-terminal region. The lipobox sequence is Leu-(Ala/Ser)-(Gly/Ala)-Cys, where the first three residues form the C-terminus of the signal peptide. During maturation the signal peptide is removed by cleavage between the (Gly/Ala) and Cys residues, so that the cysteine residue becomes the N-terminal residue.
/
/Due to its hydrophobic region, the signal peptide is embedded in the inner membrane, thus attaching the prolipoprotein to the membrane. In Gram negative bacteria, it is facing the perisplasmic side.
/
/The first step in the maturation of lipoprotein involves the formation of a thioether linkage between the sulfhydryl group of the cysteine residue and diacylglycerol, while still embedded in the membrane. The two fatty acids connected to the diacylglycerol are also inserted into the membrane, resulting in three membrane anchors (the two fatty acids and the signal peptide). In the next step, the signal lipid is cleaves, leaving the protein attached to the membrane by the two fatty acids of the diacylglycerol molecule |CITS: [27871940]|.

COMMENT - The bacterial bag-shaped envelope (sacculus) can resist turgor pressures of 2-5 atmospheres in Gram-negative bacteria, and up to 20 atm in Gram-positive bacteria. This remarkable tensile strength, combined with elasticity, is achieved by the structure of the cell wall's main component, peptidoglycan (also known as "basal structure", "mucopeptide", "glycopeptide", "glycosaminopeptide" and "murein").
/
/Peptidoglycan is best described as a fisherman net. The net is made of parallel, rather inextensible glycan threads consisting of alternating |FRAME: N-ACETYL-BETA-D-GLUCOSAMINE| (GlcNAc) and |FRAME: CPD-19950| (MurNAc) sugars, which are held together by small elastic peptide crosslinks which are formed between the side-chains of the different strands, allowing the net to expand or shrink |CITS: [10532377]|.
/
/The structure below shows a region of peptidoglycan consisting of two monomers with pentapeptide side chains. R1 and R2 refer to the parts of the polymer upstream and downstream. Many variations exist in regard to the composition of the side chain.

COMMON-NAME - a [TusD]-L-cysteine
COMMENT - |FRAME: TusD TusD| functions as a sulfur mediator during synthesis of 2-thiouridine of the modified wobble base mnm<sup>5</sup>s<sup>2</sup>U in tRNA. TusD forms a complex with TusB and TusC.
/
/Activated sulfur appears to be transferred from |FRAME: TusA TusA| to cysteine residue C78 in TusD |CITS: [16387657][16472754]|. The sulfur is subsequently transferred to |FRAME: Sulfur-Carrier-Proteins-TusE TusE|, which is known to stimulate the transfer of sulfur from TusA to TusD.  The TusBCD complex does not appear to bind tRNA directly in an <i>in vitro</i> assay, but it does interact with TusE |CITS: [16387657]|.
/
/A crystal structure of the TusBCD complex has been determined at 2.15 &Aring; resolution.  All three subunits show
/structural similarity to a protein of unknown function, YchN |CITS: [16472754]|.
/
/A <i>tusD</i> deletion mutant lacks the 2-thio modification of mnm<sup>5</sup>s<sup>2</sup>U in tRNA and has a severe growth defect |CITS: [16387657]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Prolipoprotein-Cysteines
TYPES - PROT-CYS
COMMON-NAME - a [prolipoprotein]-L-cysteine
COMMENT - A prolipoprotein contains an N-terminal signal peptide. The protein is synthesized in the cytoplasm and then translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane. The signal peptide possesses positively charged amino acid residues in the N-terminal region and uncharged amino acids in the central hydrophobic region and contains a characteristic consensus sequence called the lipobox in the C-terminal region. The lipobox sequence is Leu-(Ala/Ser)-(Gly/Ala)-Cys, where the first three residues form the C-terminus of the signal peptide. During maturation the signal peptide is removed by cleavage between the (Gly/Ala) and Cys residues.
/
/Due to its hydrophobic region, the signal peptide is embedded in the inner membrane, thus attaching the prolipoprotein to the membrane. In Gram negative bacteria, it is facing the perisplasmic side |CITS: [27871940]|.

UNIQUE-ID - FORMYL-THF-GLU-N
TYPES - THF-Derivatives
COMMON-NAME - an <i>N</i><sup>10</sup>-formyltetrahydrofolate
ATOM-CHARGES - (32 -1)
COMMENT - |FRAME: THF-GLU-N Tetrahydrofolate| (vitamin B9) and its derivatives, commonly termed folates, are required in a variety of reactions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, where they act as carriers of one-carbon units in various oxidation states. These one-carbon units are utilized in the biosynthesis of various cellular components, including glycine, methionine, formylmethionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides.
/
/During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme |FRAME: EC-6.3.2.12|, adds a glutamate residue to |FRAME: 7-8-DIHYDROPTEROATE|, resulting in |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE|, also known as H<sub>2</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>. This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:EC-1.5.1.3| (FolA) to |FRAME: THF| (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>, or tetrahydrofolate), which can be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|.
/
/Most folate molecules are modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming folate polyglutamates (or folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamates). The glutamate residues are added by an amide linkage to the &gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by peptidases or proteases, which are specific for &alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide bonds.
/
/The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives.
/
/The glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis |CITS: [10598551]|.
/
/This class stands for 10-formyltetrahydrofolates with an unspecified number of glutamate residues.

COMMON-NAME - a methylated methyl acceptor
COMMENT - |FRAME: Methyl-Acceptors "A methyl group donor"| is a compound that can donate a methyl group to another compound in a reaction catalyzed by enzymes that belong to the |FRAME: EC-2.1.1 methyltransferase group"|.
/Prior to donating the methyl group the compound is |FRAME: Methylated-methyl-acceptors| and after donating it the compound is |FRAME: Demethylated-methyl-acceptors|.
/
/Since methylation reactions are sometimes reversible, the distinction between a methyl group donor and a methyl group acceptor is not always determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some compounds are often used as methyl group donors by the methyltransferases in reactions that are physiologically unidirectional.
/
/By far, the most common methyl group donor in biology is |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE|. However, other methyl donors exist, including |FRAME: METOH|, |FRAME: 5-METHYL-THF-GLU-N "<i>N</i><sup>5</sup>-methyl tetrahydrofolate"|, |FRAME: METHYL-THMPT|, |FRAME: METHYLAMINE|, |FRAME: DIMETHYLAMINE|, |FRAME: TRIMETHYLAMINE|, and |FRAME: CPD-7671|.
/
/This generic class can be used in reactions when the identity of the methyl group donor (or acceptor) is not known or cannot be defined.

UNIQUE-ID - Capsaicinoids
TYPES - ALKALOID
TYPES - Guaiacols
COMMON-NAME - a capsaicinoid
COMMENT - The pungency of chili or hot peppers comes from phenolic alkaloids called |FRAME: Capsaicinoids capsaicinoids|. These compounds are exclusively produced in fruits of plants belonging to the |FRAME: TAX-4071| genus. A quarter of the world population consumes hot peppers in some form daily |CITS: [16938870]|. Structurally capsaicinoids consist of a common aromatic moiety, |FRAME: CPD-9327|, modified by a short chain fatty acid that may have variable length and different degrees of saturation |CITS: [Curry99]|. 
/
/The accumulation of |FRAME: Capsaicinoids capsaicinoids| is strictly correlated with developmental stages of the fruit and usually spans the ripening stages after fruit size increase has ceased |CITS: [SUKRASNO93]|. The capsaicinoids are localized in the epidermal cells of the fruit placenta |CITS: [12810854]|. Pungency differs considerably in species ranging from very hot to sweet peppers and has a positive correlation with the level of capsaicinoids biosynthetic gene expression |CITS: [12810854]|.
/
/|FRAME: CAPSAICIN Capsaicin| and |FRAME: CPD-9185| are the most common types. Other naturally occurring capsaicinoids include |FRAME: CPD-9182|, |FRAME: CPD-9333|, |FRAME: CPD-9331|, |FRAME: CPD-9181|, and |FRAME: CPD-9330|, which differ in the fatty acid chain length (n=7-10) and the presence and/or position of a double bond |CITS: [Curry99]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Donor-H2
TYPES - Hydride-Acceptors
COMMON-NAME - a reduced two electron carrier
ABBREV-NAME - A(H2)
COMMENT - In general, an electron carrier is a chemical entity that can accept or donate electrons from/to another chemical entity.
/When accepting electrons, it acts as an "electron acceptor". By accepting the electrons, the acceptor is reduced, and thus prior to receiving the electrons the entity is called  "an oxidized electron acceptor" and after receiving them it is called "a reduced electron acceptor".
/
/Many reduced electron acceptors are able to transfer the electrons to other molecules, becoming oxidized in the process. Thus the distinction between an electron acceptor and an electron donor is often not determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some acceptors in biological reactions only accept electrons and do not transfer them further. Those are often known as "terminal electron acceptors".
/
/While in general every chemical reaction in which electrons are transferred includes an electron donor and an electron acceptor, several molecules are commonly used in metabolism solely for the purpose of electron transfer, and are referred to in biology as electron carriers. Different biological electron carriers differ in the number of electrons that they transfer and in their electron affinity.
/
/Some of the common biological electron carriers transfer only a single electron (e.g. |FRAME: Cytochromes cytochromes|, |FRAME: Blue-Copper-Proteins "blue copper proteins"|, and some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer two electrons (e.g. some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer a hydride ion ( e.g. |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP|), and some transfer two electrons and two protons (|FRAME: ETR-Quinones quinones|, |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|).
/In addition, a number of inorganic small molecules (e.g. oxygen, nitrate, iron (III), manganese (IV), sulfate) are often used as terminal electron acceptors.
/
/In many cases, purified enzymes can act <i>in vitro</i> using an artificial electron carrier, and their <i>in vivo</i> electron carrier is not known. The classes of "unknown electron carriers" are used to describe such reactions, which are incompletely characterized.

ATOM-CHARGES - (37 -1)
ATOM-CHARGES - (35 -1)
COMMENT - |FRAME: NADH-P-OR-NOP| is a class of compounds including the instances |FRAME: NADH| and |FRAME: NADPH|.
/
/|FRAME: NAD-P-OR-NOP| is a class of compounds including the instances |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP|.
/
/|FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP| are dinucleotides containing one |FRAME: NIACINAMIDE| base and one |FRAME: ADENINE| base. Each nucleotide is connected to a ribose sugar at position 1, and the two riboses are connected at their 5 position via a diphosphate. The only difference between the two is that in NADP there is an additional phosphate group at the 2' position of the ribose that carries the adenine moiety.
/
/These molecules are biological carriers of reductive equivalents (i.e. high potential electrons). They are often referred to as coenzymes, although in most of their reactions they function as cosubstrates rather than true coenzymes.
/
/The most common function of |FRAME: NAD| is to accept two electrons and a proton (a hydride ion) from a substrate that is being oxidized. This reduction converts |FRAME: NAD| to |FRAME: NADH|, the reduced form. NADH then diffuses or is transported to a terminal oxidase, where the electrons are passed on, regenerating the oxidized form.
/
/|FRAME: NADPH|, on the other hand, is mostly involved in biosynthetic reactions, where it serves as an electron donor. NADPH is formed by reduction of |FRAME: NADP|, which occurs by different mechanisms in different types of organisms. In photosynthetic organisms |FRAME: NADP| is reduced by |FRAME: CPLX-84|. In heterotrophic organisms it is reduced by central metabolism processes such as the pentose phosphate pathway (see |FRAME: OXIDATIVEPENT-PWY|).

TYPES - Organic-aromatic-compounds
COMMON-NAME - a phenylpropanoid
COMMENT - The phenylpropanoids are a large family of compounds, mostly found in plants, that are synthesized from |FRAME: PHE| and, to a lesser extent, |FRAME: TYR|. The pathway that starts from |FRAME: PHE| forms |FRAME: COUMARATE| as a main intermediate. The name "phenylpropanoid" is derived from this compound, which consists of an aromatic phenyl group and a propene tail. Further processing results in the biosynthesis of many types of compounds, including |FRAME: Lignols monolignols| (precursors to |FRAME: Lignins lignin| and lignocellulose), |FRAME: Flavonoids flavonoids|, |FRAME: Coumarins coumarins|, |FRAME: Stilbenoids stilbenoids|, and phenolic acids.
/
/Phenylpropanoids are found throughout the plant kingdom, where they serve as essential components of a number of structural polymers, provide protection from ultraviolet light, defend against herbivores and pathogens, and also mediate plant-pollinator interactions as floral pigments and scent compounds.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Methyl-Acceptors "A methyl group donor"| is a compound that can donate a methyl group to another compound in a reaction catalyzed by enzymes that belong to the |FRAME: EC-2.1.1 methyltransferase group"|.
/Prior to donating the methyl group the compound is |FRAME: Methylated-methyl-acceptors| and after donating it the compound is |FRAME: Demethylated-methyl-acceptors|.
/
/Since methylation reactions are sometimes reversible, the distinction between a methyl group donor and a methyl group acceptor is not always determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some compounds are often used as methyl group donors by the methyltransferases in reactions that are physiologically unidirectional.
/
/By far, the most common methyl group donor in biology is |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE|. However, other methyl donors exist, including |FRAME: METOH|, |FRAME: 5-METHYL-THF-GLU-N "<i>N</i><sup>5</sup>-methyl tetrahydrofolate"|, |FRAME: METHYL-THMPT|, |FRAME: METHYLAMINE|, |FRAME: DIMETHYLAMINE|, |FRAME: TRIMETHYLAMINE|, and |FRAME: CPD-7671|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: Cobamides "A cobamide"| is a corrinoid molecule based on the structure of |FRAME: CPD-20843|, a cobalt-corrinoid hexaamide that is formed from |FRAME: COBINAMIDE| by the attachment of an &alpha;-D-ribofuranose 3-phosphate residue at the 2 position of the aminopropanol chain.
/
/Biologically active forms of cobamides contain an upper (&beta;) and a lower (&alpha;) axial ligands. The most common upper axial ligand are either a methyl group or a 5'-deoxyadenosyl group, although some other forms exist. More variability is found with the lower axial ligand, where more that 16 different forms have been described. This class includes all cobamides that have a 5'-deoxyadenosyl group as their upper axial ligand.

COMMENT - 'Heme' is usually understood as any tetrapyrrolic chelate of iron. The terms 'ferroheme' and 'ferriheme' refer to the Fe(II) and Fe(III) oxidation states in heme (even though Fe(IV) is found as a catalytic intermediate in some systems).
/
/|FRAME: HEME_A "Heme <i>a</i>"| was first isolated in 1951 and shown to be the active component of the integral membrane metalloprotein |FRAME: EC-7.1.1.9| |CITS: [Warburg51]|. The correct structure was published in 1975 |CITS: [170266]|.
/
/The immediate product of the initial heme biosynthesis pathways (by ferro-chelation of |FRAME: PROTOPORPHYRIN_IX|) is |FRAME: Heme-b "heme <i>b</i>"|, whose |FRAME: PROTOHEME "ferrous form"| is known as protoheme IX. |FRAME: HEME_A "Heme <i>a</i>"| differs from heme <i>b</i> in that a methyl side chain at position 8 of the D ring is oxidized to a formyl group, and a hydroxyethylfarnesyl chain is attached to the vinyl side chain at position 2 of the A ring. It is synthesized from |FRAME: Heme-b| via |FRAME: HEME_O| by two enzymes - |FRAME: EC-2.5.1.141|, and heme <i>a</i> synthase. It has been found that the latter acts by two successive hydroxylations, with the first hydroxylation forming a short-lived |FRAME: Heme_I| intermediate |CITS: [7885224][12206660]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Redox-Electron-Carriers
TYPES - Acceptors
COMMON-NAME - a redox electron carrier
COMMENT - In general, an electron carrier is a chemical entity that can accept or donate electrons from/to another chemical entity.
/When accepting electrons, it acts as an "electron acceptor". By accepting the electrons, the acceptor is reduced, and thus prior to receiving the electrons the entity is called  "an oxidized electron acceptor" and after receiving them it is called "a reduced electron acceptor".
/
/Many reduced electron acceptors are able to transfer the electrons to other molecules, becoming oxidized in the process. Thus the distinction between an electron acceptor and an electron donor is often not determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some acceptors in biological reactions only accept electrons and do not transfer them further. Those are often known as "terminal electron acceptors".
/
/While in general every chemical reaction in which electrons are transferred includes an electron donor and an electron acceptor, several molecules are commonly used in metabolism solely for the purpose of electron transfer, and are referred to in biology as electron carriers. Different biological electron carriers differ in the number of electrons that they transfer and in their electron affinity.
/
/Some of the common biological electron carriers transfer only a single electron (e.g. |FRAME: Cytochromes cytochromes|, |FRAME: Blue-Copper-Proteins "blue copper proteins"|, and some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer two electrons (e.g. some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer a hydride ion ( e.g. |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP|), and some transfer two electrons and two protons (|FRAME: ETR-Quinones quinones|, |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|).
/In addition, a number of inorganic small molecules (e.g. oxygen, nitrate, iron (III), manganese (IV), sulfate) are often used as terminal electron acceptors.

UNIQUE-ID - POLYKETIDE

COMMON-NAME - a polyketide
COMMENT - Polyketides are secondary metabolites produced by some bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
/Polyketides are usually biosynthesized by |FRAME: Polyketide-Synthases "polyketide synthase"| (PKS) enzymes through the decarboxylative condensation of extender units that are derived from malonyl-CoA, in a process similar to fatty acid synthesis.
/
/PKSs can be divided to two types: multifunctional polyproteins (type I) and discrete protein (type II).
/Type I PKSs are organized into modular complexes, each catalyzing individual chain elongation steps using an associated carrier protein. The minimal type I PKS module consists of 3 domains: a ketosynthase, a acyltransferase, and an acyl-carrier protein (ACP). The acyltransferase domain catalyzes the priming of the flanking ACP domain with the appropriate substrate.
/
/Type II PKS ACPs, on the other hand, possess catalytic self-acylation activity |CITS: [18059524]|.

ATOM-CHARGES - (32 -1)
COMMENT - |FRAME: THF-GLU-N Tetrahydrofolate| (vitamin B9) and its derivatives, commonly termed folates, are required in a variety of reactions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, where they act as carriers of one-carbon units in various oxidation states. These one-carbon units are utilized in the biosynthesis of several cellular components, including glycine, methionine, formylmethionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides.
/
/During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme |FRAME: EC-6.3.2.12|, adds a glutamate residue to |FRAME: 7-8-DIHYDROPTEROATE|, resulting in |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE|, also known as H<sub>2</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>. This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:EC-1.5.1.3| (FolA) to |FRAME: THF| (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>, or tetrahydrofolate), which can be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|.
/
/Most folate molecules are modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming folate polyglutamates (or folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamates). The glutamate residues are added by an amide linkage to the &gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by peptidases or proteases, which are specific for &alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide bonds.
/
/The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives.
/
/The glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis |CITS: [10598551]|.
/
/Among the many folates |FRAME:5-FORMYL-THF "(6S)-5-formyltetrahydrofolate"| is the most enigmatic compound involved in the folate biosynthesis. |FRAME:5-FORMYL-THF| is the only folate derivative that does not serve as a cofactor in C1-metabolism, but it is the most frequent and stable form of folates found in plants |CITS: [8480361]|. Moreover, |FRAME:5-FORMYL-THF| is known to inhibit most of the folate dependent enzymes at physiological concentrations. The biological role of this compound is still poorly understood but it has been discussed as factor involved in the regulation of essential biosynthetic steps such as the formation of serine during photorespiration |CITS: [15888445][12207015]|.
/
/This class stands for (6<i>S</i>)-5-formyltetrahydrofolates with an unspecified number of glutamate residues.

COMMENT - Fucose is a hexose deoxy sugar. It received its name from the brown algae genus |FRAME: TAX-3011|, from which it was first decribed. The alga was named because of its dark redish color, as one of the meanings of the Latin word <i>fucus</i> is "red paint".
/
/Algae of the |FRAME: TAX-3009| order produce fucose-rich polysaccahrides known as |FRAME: Fucoidans fucoidans|. However, fucose is a common sugar, found in <i>N</i>-linked glycans on the mammalian, insect and plant cell surface, in many bacterial glycans, and in other biomolecules.
/
/Most of the fucose found in biology is in the |FRAME: L-fucoses "L conformation"|, and the use of |FRAME: D-Fucoses| is rather rare (for example in some |FRAME: Cardenolide-Glycosides "cardenolide glycosides"|).
/
/Note that fucose is a reducing sugar that exists in solution in multiple configurations. The open-chain structure shown here is provided only as a schematic illustration of chirality. Consult the appropriate class instances for information on specific ring structures and their anomeric configuration.

COMMENT - |FRAME: CARNITINE L-Carnitine| is a ubiquitously occurring trimethylammonium compound that plays several roles in metabolism. Carnitine was first discovered in 1905 in muscle extracts, and the name is derived from the Latin word for flesh, Carnis |CITS: [11183736]|. In 1962 it was found that the physiological enantiomer is |FRAME: CARNITINE|, and since then its widespread distribution has been established in higher and lower eukaryotes, plants, and many microorganisms |CITS: [9706218]|. In eukaryotes, among other roles, it is essential for the transport of long-chain fatty acids through the inner mitochondrial membrane. The physiological role of carnitine in bacteria is still unknown |CITS: [9037756]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Quinones
TYPES - Cyclic-Ketones
COMMON-NAME - a quinone
COMMENT - Quinones are organic compounds derived from aromatic compounds, with two carbonyl groups incorporated into the ring structure with rearrangement of the double bonds where necessary. Quinones are conjugated but not aromatic.
/
/A classic example of a quinone is |FRAME: P-BENZOQUINONE|. Quinones are commonly named with a prefix that indicates the parent aromatic hydrocarbon (for example, "benzo-" for benzene, "naphtho-" for naphthalene, and "anthra-" for anthracene) with a "-quinone" suffix.
/
/Several types of quinones serve as electron acceptors in electron transport chains. Quinones can carry two electrons, and when fully reduced they are referred to as |FRAME: Reduced-Quinones quinols|. The addition of a single H atom to a quinone results in formation of a free radical called |FRAME: Semiquinones|.
/
/Many quinone derivatives often have other biological activities, such as |FRAME: CPD-11501 "vitamin K"|.

UNIQUE-ID - CPD0-1099
TYPES - Exopolysaccharides
COMMON-NAME - a colanic acid
COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD0-1099 "Colanic acid"| is an exopolysaccharide secreted by |FRAME: TAX-562| and a number of other |FRAME: TAX-543| that encapsulates the organism, resulting in a mucoid appearance |CITS: [13963285]|. Colanic acid is thought to promote biofilm formation and to protect the organism when exposed to harsh environments such as acidic conditions |CITS:  [11371548][16706906]|.
/
/Even though it wasn't identified as such, colanic acid was first described in 1927 by Dorothea Smith, who isolated a polysaccharide from a mucoid strain of |FRAME: TAX-562| |CITS: [19869322]|. Fourteen years later, in a study on the antigens of the <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>, it was noticed that one antigen was common to several mucoid strains of |FRAME: TAX-57045| |CITS: [Kauffmann41]|. It was soon reported that the same antigen, which was named "M" antigen, is produced by mucoid <i>Escherichia coli</i> strains |CITS: [15406247]|. In 1954 Kauffmann reported that the antigen was common to all mucoid <i>Salmonella</i> species |CITS: [Kauffmann54]|.
/
/Similar exopolysaccharides were reported from a number of mucoid strains and species |CITS: [13475241][13641209][13963285][14073028][5324934]|. In the early 60s it was reported that a large number of <i>Salmonella</i> and <i>Escherichia</i> strains that are not normally mucoid can be induced to form slime exopolysaccharides when grown at 15 to 20&deg;C in high phosphate concentration |CITS: [Anderson61][Anderson63]|, and the exopolysaccharide was named "colanic acid" after |FRAME: TAX-562| from which it was isolated |CITS: [13963285]|. In a paper describing the discovery of the same polysaccharide in |FRAME: TAX-83333| it was suggested that colanic acid and the "M antigen" reported in the earlier studies are identical |CITS: [14206589]|. A confirmation was obtained in 1969 when it was shown that colanic acid of identical composition is produced by strains from the genera <i>Salmonella</i>, <i>Escherichia</i>, and <i>Aerobacter</i>. At that time the exact structure was not known, though it was known that the polysaccharide contains glucose, galactose, fucose, and glucuronate, as well as some <i>O</i>-acetyl groups |CITS: [ 4902806]|.
/
/Additional structural studies have shown that colanic acid from different organisms is very similar, with the polysaccharide composed of a hexasaccharide repeating unit consisting of glucose, two fucoses, two galactoses, and glucuronate. In addition, one fucose and one galactose may be acetylated to varying degrees, and the terminal galactose residue is modified. The repeat units are connected by a linkage between the first and third residues, with the remaining three residues forming a side chain |CITS: [4311825][4902692]|. Differences are found in the modifications of the terminal galactose residue, which was found to contain a 4,6-pyruvoyl group, a 3,4-pyruvoyl group, a 3,4-ethylidene group, or a 4,6-methylene group in different strains |CITS: [4941627]|. The structure shown here was published in 2007, correcting several errors in earlier reports |CITS: [17227761]|. While colanic acid was considered exclusively an exopolysaccharide that is only loosely associated with the cell surface, the 2007 study also found that colanic acid can be attached to the lipid A core of lipopolysaccharide instead of the O antigen, forming a novel type of lipopolysaccharide which was named |FRAME: 
/CPD0-1101 M<sub>LPS</sub>| |CITS: [17227761]|.

COMMENT - A porphyrin is a heterocyclic macrocycle derived from porphine, a molecule that consists of four pyrrole
/rings joined together by four methine (=CH-) groups to form a larger macrocycle ring.
/Substituted porphines are called porphyrins. Many porphyrins occur in nature, and fulfil important
/biochemical roles. 
/Porphyrins can bind metals to form complexes. The metal ion, usually with a charge of 2+ or 3+,
/resides in the central cavity formed by the loss of two protons. Many metals are found with different
/derivatives, including Fe, Mg, Ni, Co and Zn.
/The name porphyrin comes from a Greek word for purple, since most porphyrins are red to purple
/in color. More reduced porphyrins, such as corphins, are yellowish.

COMMENT - <i>Anteiso</i>-fatty acids are a class of branched-chain fatty acids (BCFA) that are characterized by a methyl-substituent located on the antepenultimate carbon of the carboxyalkyl chain.
/
/<i>Anteiso</i>-fatty acids are the most prominent fatty acids of cell membranes of some bacteria, especially of the genus <i>Bacillus</i>. The most relevant anteiso-fatty acids in food and bacteria are |FRAME: CPD-9917| and |FRAME: CPD-23509| |CITS: [28129363]|.
/
/Unlike classic fatty acids and |FRAME: Iso-fatty-acids "<i>iso</i>-fatty acids"|, <i>anteiso</i>-fatty acids are chiral molecules due to the stereogenic center at the carbon of the branching point. A distinct pre-dominance of (<i>S</i>)-<i>anteiso</i>-fatty acids, or even (<i>S</i>)-enantiopurity has been described in bacteria |CITS: [1886522][20117788]|, and also in fish |CITS: [13373794][17508720][20221853]|, dairy products |CITS: [13373794][13412644][13827622][20221853]|, mutton fat |CITS: [13018208]|, and Brussel sprouts |CITS: [26390192]|.

COMMENT - Exopolysaccharides (EPS) are high-molecular-weight polymers that are composed of sugar residues and are secreted by a microorganism into the surrounding environment. Exopolysaccharides generally consist of a single type of saccharide and some non-carbohydrate substituents (such as acetate, pyruvate, succinate, and phosphate).
/
/Unlike lipopolysaccharides, which are attached to a lipid anchor, EPS refers to extracellular polysaccharides with slight or no cell association.

COMMENT - Steroid hormones are steroids that act as hormones. Steroid hormones are divided into five groups based on the receptors to which they bind: |FRAME: Glucocorticoids glucocorticoids|, |FRAME: Mineralocorticoids mineralocorticoids|, |FRAME: Androgens androgens|, |FRAME: Steroidal-Estrogens "steroidal estrogens"|, and |FRAME: Progestogens progestogens|. Certain vitamin D derivatives (e.g. |FRAME: CALCITRIOL|) are sometimes considered a sixth steroid hormone group.

UNIQUE-ID - Cyanocobamides
TYPES - Cobamides
TYPES - Nitriles
COMMON-NAME - a cyanocobamide
COMMENT - |FRAME: Cobamides "A cobamide"| is a corrinoid molecule based on the structure of |FRAME: CPD-20843|, a cobalt-corrinoid hexaamide that is formed from |FRAME: COBINAMIDE| by the attachment of an &alpha;-D-ribofuranose 3-phosphate residue at the 2 position of the aminopropanol chain.
/
/Biologically active forms of cobamides contain an upper (&beta;) and a lower (&alpha;) axial ligands. The most common upper axial ligand are either a methyl group or a 5'-deoxyadenosyl group, although some other forms exist. More variability is found with the lower axial ligand, where more that 16 different forms have been described.
/
/Some procedure for cobamide purification involve the replacement of the upper ligand with a cyano group. A common example is |FRAME:CPD-315|, also known as vitamin B12. Cyanocobamides do not occur in living organisms, and are only produced artificially.
/
/This class includes all cobamides that have a cyano group as their upper axial ligand.

UNIQUE-ID - Phospholipid-Cyclopropane-Fatty-Acids
TYPES - Fatty-Acids-Within-Glycerolipids
COMMON-NAME - a [phospholipid] fatty acid containing cyclopropane
COMMENT - Some organisms produce phospholipids in which the fatty acyl chains contain cyclopropane rings. These rings are formed by tenzymes that transfer a methylene moiety from S-adenosylL-methionine to double bonds of unsaturated fatty acyl chains within the lipids.
/
/In most organisms the cyclopropane groups are <i>cis</i>-configured and are formed by the action of |FRAME: EC-2.1.1.79|, which acts only on <i>cis</i> double bonds. The |FRAME: MYCOLIC-ACIDS "mycolic acids"| of mycobacteria often contain additional <i>trans</i>-configured cyclopropane groups that are formed by |FRAME: EC-2.1.1.M101| |CITS: [16741578]|.
/
/The physiological role of cyclopropane-containing fatty acyl chains (CFA) is to stabilize the membranes by increased ordering of the chains without sacrificing membrane fluidity. This can decrease the proton permeability of phospholipid bilayers, helping the bacteria survive acid shock |CITS: [9310851][18562182][25804677]|. <i>trans</i>-configured CFA in mycolic acids were reported to be correlated with the persistence of the pathogen and to modulate the innate immune response of the host |CITS: [15710652]|.
/
/The structures shown here depicts a C13:cyclopropane within a phospholipid. This compound was randomly selected to represent a member of this compound class.

COMMON-NAME - a W/Mo-molybdopterin cofactor
COMMENT - The transition element molybdenum is an essential micronutrient for microorganisms, plants, and animals. Molybdenum itself is catalytically inactive and needs to be complexed by a special cofactor to gain catalytic activity.  It is bound to a unique pterin (molybdopterin, or MPT), forming the molybdenum cofactor, often referred to as MoCo |CITS: [23539623]|.
/
/The MoCo form that is synthesized initially is |FRAME: CPD-15870|. In eukaryotes this form is incorporated into enzymes as-is, or undergoes sulfurylation as described in |FRAME: PWY-5963|. However, in prokaryotes the initial form is modified into many different forms. For example, enzymes of the xanthine oxidase family utilize |FRAME: CPD-23445| (MCD), while enzymes of the DMSO reductase family utilize |FRAME: CPD-15873| (bis-MGD) |CITS: [21528011]|.
/
/This class holds molybdopterin cofactors (MoCo) in which the coordinated metal is a mononuclear molybdenum or molybdate species.

UNIQUE-ID - Methyl-Acceptors
TYPES - Acceptors
COMMON-NAME - a methyl acceptor
COMMENT - |FRAME: Methyl-Acceptors "A methyl group donor"| is a compound that can donate a methyl group to another compound in a reaction catalyzed by enzymes that belong to the |FRAME: EC-2.1.1 methyltransferase group"|.
/Prior to donating the methyl group the compound is |FRAME: Methylated-methyl-acceptors| and after donating it the compound is |FRAME: Demethylated-methyl-acceptors|.
/
/Since methylation reactions are sometimes reversible, the distinction between a methyl group donor and a methyl group acceptor is not always determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some compounds are often used as methyl group donors by the methyltransferases in reactions that are physiologically unidirectional.
/
/By far, the most common methyl group donor in biology is |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE|. However, other methyl donors exist, including |FRAME: METOH|, |FRAME: 5-METHYL-THF-GLU-N "<i>N</i><sup>5</sup>-methyl tetrahydrofolate"|, |FRAME: METHYL-THMPT|, |FRAME: METHYLAMINE|, |FRAME: DIMETHYLAMINE|, |FRAME: TRIMETHYLAMINE|, and |FRAME: CPD-7671|.

COMMENT - Fucose is a hexose deoxy sugar. It received its name from the brown algae genus |FRAME: TAX-3011|, from which it was first decribed. The alga was named because of its dark redish color, as one of the meanings of the Latin word <i>fucus</i> is "red paint".
/
/Algae of the |FRAME: TAX-3009| order produce fucose-rich polysaccahrides known as |FRAME: Fucoidans fucoidans|. However, fucose is a common sugar, found in <i>N</i>-linked glycans on the mammalian, insect and plant cell surface, in many bacterial glycans, and in other biomolecules.
/
/Most of the fucose found in biology is in the |FRAME: L-fucoses "L conformation"|, and the use of |FRAME: D-Fucoses| is rather rare (for example in some |FRAME: Cardenolide-Glycosides "cardenolide glycosides"|).
/
/This compound stands for a mixture of |FRAME: CPD-10329| and |FRAME: CPD0-1107|. In most cases, each of these compounds mutarotates quickly to form a mixture of the two, and thus it is the general rule to use this non-specific form in reactions unless it is specifically known that an enzyme can accept only one of the forms.

UNIQUE-ID - Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids
TYPES - Fatty-Acids
COMMON-NAME - an unsaturated fatty acid
COMMENT - |FRAME: Fatty-Acids "A fatty acid"| is a carboxylic acid with a long unbranched aliphatic tail.
/Even though fatty acids derived from natural fats and oils, such as |FRAME:CPD-195|, are usually at least 8 carbon atoms long, carboxylic acids as short as |FRAME:BUTYRIC_ACID| (4 carbon atoms) are considered to be fatty acids.
/
/When a fatty acid contains only single bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Saturated-Fatty-Acids|. When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|. If it contains a double bond in the <i>trans</i> configuration, it is often referred to as a <i>trans</i> fatty acid. Most fatty acids in the <i>trans</i> configuration are not found in nature and are the result of human processing.
/
/<b>About nomenclature</b>: Several nomenclatures are used for unsaturated fatty acids, and are not complementary. Systematic names (or IUPAC names) begin counting the carbon atoms from the carboxylic acid end, and the double bonds are labelled with <i>cis</i>/<i>trans</i> or E/Z notation, e.g. 8<i>E</i>,10<i>E</i>,12<i>Z</i>-octadecatrienoate. However, unsaturated fatty acids are often described using the omega nomenclature, which begins counting the carbon atoms from the terminal methyl carbon (designated as <i>n</i> or &omega;).
/In addition, unsaturated fatty acids are often referred to by trivial names, or by the "lipid number" as in 18:3, where 18 is the number of carbons, and 3 is the number of double bonds. This notation is ambiguous, as it does not specify the location of the double bonds.

COMMENT - |FRAME: SULFOQUINOVOSYLDIACYLGLYCEROL "Sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol"| (SQDG) is an abundant class of sulfolipids composed of a glycoside of |FRAME: CPD-10247| and |FRAME: 1-2-Diglycerides diacylglycerol|, which are found in many photosynthetic organisms, including all photosynthetic plants, algae, cyanobacteria, and purple sulfur and non-sulfur bacteria.
/
/SQDG is synthesized from |FRAME: UDP-SULFOQUINOVOSE| by the action of |FRAME: EC-2.4.1.M2|. The synthesis of SQDG is not crucial under normal growth conditions. It only becomes important when phosphate is limited |CITS: [9465123]|. Under such conditions, the increase of SQDG levels compensates for the decrease in phospholipids and ensures a constant proportion of anionic lipids in photosynthetic membranes |CITS:[14675442]|.
/
/SQDG is localized in photosynthetic membranes (in plants in the thylakoid membranes), where it is closely associated with certain membrane proteins.

/
/|FRAME: Short-Chain-Acyl-CoAs "Short-chain acyl-CoAs"|  are derived from |FRAME: Short-chain-fatty-acids "fatty acids that have 3-5 carbons in the longest chain"|.
/
/|FRAME: Medium-Chain-Acyl-CoAs "Medium-chain acyl-CoAs"|  are derived from |FRAME: Medium-chain-fatty-acids "fatty acids that have 6-12 carbons in the longest chain"|.

COMMENT - The peptide moiety, which is bound through its N terminus to the carboxyl group of muramate and contains alternating L and D amino acids, reveals considerable variation. The amino acid linked directly to muramate is usually |FRAME:L-ALPHA-ALANINE|, but in some cases can be replaced by |FRAME: GLY| or |FRAME: SER| |CITS: [5777324][5965240][4385976][6029599][5704800][5469569][6033749]|.
/
/The most common amino acid in the second position is |FRAME: D-GLT|, but in some cases (in a few coryneform bacteria) it is hydroxylated to |FRAME: CPD-48| |CITS: [6072398]|. In some organisms the &alpha;-carboxyl group of |FRAME: D-GLT| is modified by amidation or substituted by |FRAME: GLY| |CITS: [5965232][6064598]|, by |FRAME: GLYCINAMIDE| |CITS: [Interschick70]|, or by |FRAME: CPD0-1578| |CITS: [4683671]|.
/
/The greatest variation occurs at position 3. The residue at this position is usually a diamino acid and is involved in cross-linking through the second amino group. The most common residue at this position is |FRAME: MESO-DIAMINOPIMELATE|, which is present in probably all Gram-negative bacteria and in many other organisms, such as some species of bacilli, clostridia, lactobacilli, corynebacteria, propionibacteria, Actinomycetales, Myxobacteriales, Rickettsiae, and cyanobacteria |CITS: [410379][6131881]| (see |FRAME:PEPTIDOGLYCANSYN-PWY|).
/The second common residue at this position is |FRAME: LYS|, but other substituition have been documented, including |FRAME: L-ORNITHINE| |CITS: [4884715][14152785][6035494][6031807]|, |FRAME:LL-DIAMINOPIMELATE| |CITS: [14024243][13882624][13525638][11945321]|, |FRAME: CPD-7690| |CITS: [5870104]|, and |FRAME: 5-HYDROXY-L-LYSINE| |CITS: [16562051]|. In some cases the diamino acid in position 3 is not involved in cross linking. In these cases
/the residue in position 3 can be |FRAME: N-ACETYL-L-24-DIAMINOBUTANOATE|, as in the case of <i>Clavibacter michiganensis</i> |CITS: [5704800][5119774]|, or even a monoamino acid, such as |FRAME:L-ALPHA-ALANINE| |FRAME: GLT| |CITS: [4259817]| or |FRAME: HOMO-SER| |CITS: [5119774][5119774 ][5469569]|.
/
/Position 4 and 5 are almost always occupied by |FRAME: D-ALA-D-ALA| di-peptide. In several species enterococci and lactobacilli, the terminal |FRAME:D-ALANINE| is replaced by |FRAME:D-LACTATE| |CITS: [1503450]| or |FRAME:D-SERINE| |CITS: [8852545]|, which entails resistance to the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin.

COMMON-NAME - a vitamin
COMMENT - A vitamin is an organic molecule (or a set of closely related molecules) that an organism requires in small quantities for the proper functioning of its metabolism, but is unable to synthesize <i>de novo</i> and thus must aquire in its diet. Most vitamins are not single molecules, but groups of related molecules called vitamers, which can be converted to each other by enzymes present in the organism.
/
/Compounds that are required in large quantity (e.g. essential amino acids) or compounds that are inorganic (i.e. minerals) are not considered vitamins.
/
/Vitamins have diverse biochemical functions (e.g. enzyme cofactors, regulators of growth and differentiation, hormones, etc).

/
/Activated sulfur appears to be transferred from |FRAME: TusA TusA| to cysteine residue C78 in TusD |CITS: [16387657][16472754]|.

/
/|FRAME: Short-Chain-Alcohols "Short-chain alcohols"| have 3-5 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Medium-Chain-Alcohols "Medium-chain alcohols"| have 6-12 carbons in the longest chain.

COMMENT - An aromatic compound contains one or more aromatic rings. The pi orbitals of the ring's atoms form a conjugated system and are in resonance, giving increased stability compared to saturated compounds having a similar structure. As a result aromatic rings are very stable and do not break apart easily.
/
/Similar structures in which at least one of the ring's carbon atoms  is replaced by one of the heteroatoms oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur, are called heteroarenes.

UNIQUE-ID - Polyunsaturated-fatty-acids
TYPES - Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids
COMMON-NAME - a polyunsaturated fatty acid
ATOM-CHARGES - (1 -1)
COMMENT - |FRAME: Fatty-Acids "A fatty acid"| is a carboxylic acid with a long unbranched aliphatic tail.
/Even though fatty acids derived from natural fats and oils, such as |FRAME:CPD-195|, are usually at least 8 carbon atoms long, carboxylic acids as short as |FRAME:BUTYRIC_ACID| (4 carbon atoms) are considered to be fatty acids.
/
/When a fatty acid contains only single bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Saturated-Fatty-Acids|. When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|. |FRAME: Polyunsaturated-fatty-acids "Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)"| are fatty acids that contain more than one double bond in their backbone. This class includes many important compounds, such as essential fatty acids and those that give drying oils their characteristic property.
/
/<b>About nomenclature</b>: Several nomenclatures are used for unsaturated fatty acids, and are not complementary. Systematic names (or IUPAC names) begin counting the carbon atoms from the carboxylic acid end, and the double bonds are labeled with <i>cis</i>/<i>trans</i> or (preferably) E/Z notation, e.g. (8<i>E</i>,10<i>E</i>,12<i>Z</i>)-octadeca-8,10,12-trienoate. However, unsaturated fatty acids are often described using the omega nomenclature, which begins counting the carbon atoms from the terminal methyl carbon (designated as <i>n</i> or &omega;).
/In addition, unsaturated fatty acids are often referred to by trivial names, or by the "lipid number" as in 18:3, where 18 is the number of carbons, and 3 is the number of double bonds. This notation is ambiguous, as it does not specify the location of the double bonds.

UNIQUE-ID - Donor-H1
TYPES - Hydride-Acceptors
COMMON-NAME - a reduced one electron carrier
ABBREV-NAME - A(H)
COMMENT - In general, an electron carrier is a chemical entity that can accept or donate electrons from/to another chemical entity.
/When accepting electrons, it acts as an "electron acceptor". By accepting the electrons, the acceptor is reduced, and thus prior to receiving the electrons the entity is called  "an oxidized electron acceptor" and after receiving them it is called "a reduced electron acceptor".
/
/Many reduced electron acceptors are able to transfer the electrons to other molecules, becoming oxidized in the process. Thus the distinction between an electron acceptor and an electron donor is often not determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some acceptors in biological reactions only accept electrons and do not transfer them further. Those are often known as "terminal electron acceptors".
/
/While in general every chemical reaction in which electrons are transferred includes an electron donor and an electron acceptor, several molecules are commonly used in metabolism solely for the purpose of electron transfer, and are referred to in biology as electron carriers. Different biological electron carriers differ in the number of electrons that they transfer and in their electron affinity.
/
/Some of the common biological electron carriers transfer only a single electron (e.g. |FRAME: Cytochromes cytochromes|, |FRAME: Blue-Copper-Proteins "blue copper proteins"|, and some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer two electrons (e.g. some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer a hydride ion ( e.g. |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP|), and some transfer two electrons and two protons (|FRAME: ETR-Quinones quinones|, |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|).
/In addition, a number of inorganic small molecules (e.g. oxygen, nitrate, iron (III), manganese (IV), sulfate) are often used as terminal electron acceptors.
/
/In many cases, purified enzymes can act <i>in vitro</i> using an artificial electron carrier, and their <i>in vivo</i> electron carrier is not known. The classes of "unknown electron carriers" are used to describe such reactions, which are incompletely characterized.

UNIQUE-ID - Medium-chain-fatty-acids
TYPES - Fatty-Acids
TYPES - Medium-Chain-Carboxylates
COMMON-NAME - a medium chain fatty acid
ATOM-CHARGES - (7 -1)
COMMENT - The term "fatty acid" was originally coined to describe aliphatic monocarboxylic acids derived from or contained in esterified form in an animal or vegetable fat, oil or wax. However, over the years the term has been expanded to refer to additional, shorter monocarboxylic acids with an aliphatic tail such as |FRAME: PROPIONATE| and |FRAME: BUTYRIC_ACID| (but not the shorter |FRAME: FORMATE| and |FRAME: ACET|).
/
/The length of a fatty acid is determined by the length of the longest carbon chain, including the carbon of the carboxy group. Common natural fatty acids usually have an even number of carbons in the longest chain and can be either saturated or unsaturated. In many organisms they are often modified by branching, hydroxylation, methylation, epoxidation and other types of modifications.
/
/Inside living cells fatty acids are rarely found in free form. They are usually bound to coenzyme A or acyl-carrier proteins, or form part of |FRAME: Triacylglycerides triglycerides|, |FRAME: Phospholipids phospholipids|, |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides lipopolysaccharides|, and |FRAME: Cholesterol-esters cholesterol esters|.
/
/Many enzymes that act on fatty acids, as well as the corresponding |FRAME: Fatty-Acyl-CoAs "fatty acyl-CoAs"|, alcohols, and aldehydes, have evolved to recognize substrates with a limited range of chain lengths. To classify these enzymes, it is helpful to divide the substrates into smaller groups based on their chain length. The following subgroups have been defined:
/
/|FRAME: Short-chain-fatty-acids "Short-chain fatty acids"| (SCFA) have 3-5 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Medium-chain-fatty-acids "Medium-chain fatty acids"| (MCFA) have 6-12 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Long-Chain-Fatty-Acids "Long-chain fatty acids"| (LCFA) have 13-22 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Very-long-chain-fatty-acids "Very-long-chain fatty acids"| (VLCFA) have 23-27 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Ultra-long-chain-fatty-acids "Ultra-long-chain fatty acids"| (ULCFA) have more than 27 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/Most of the natural fatty acids have an even number of carbon atoms, since their biosynthesis involves the addition of two-carbon-atom units. When a fatty acid contains only single bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Saturated-Fatty-Acids|. When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|. If it contains a double bond in the <i>trans</i> configuration, it is often referred to as a <i>trans</i> fatty acid. Most fatty acids in the <i>trans</i> configuration are not found in nature and are the result of human processing.

COMMENT - The ubiquinones are a group of lipid-soluble benzoquinones involved in electron transport. Their structures
/have a variable length side chain, which consists of one to twelve mono-unsaturated
/<I>trans</I>-isoprenoids units, with ten units being the most common in animals.
/|FRAME: TAX-4932| has 6 units, |FRAME: TAX-71421| has 7, |FRAME: TAX-83333| has 8, |FRAME: TAX-1142|
/has 9, |FRAME: TAX-9606| has 10, and |FRAME: TAX-1270| has an 11 unit form |CITS: [16233343]|.
/
/The terms ubiquinone/ubiquinol refer to the oxidized/reduced forms, and are often used interchangeably.
/The forms are readily interconvertable. 
/
/Ubiquinone is also known as coenzyme Q, or just Q. The names are often followed by the number of the prenoid units in the side chain (e.g. Q-8), or the number of carbons in the chain. For example, the name Q-8 may be substituted with ubiquinone(40). Since these carbons occur in repeating units of five, these number are multiples of 5.

COMMENT - |FRAME: EC-2.1.1.13| is a vitamin B12-dependent zinc metalloenzyme that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from |FRAME: 5-METHYL-THF-GLU-N| to homocysteine.
/
/Methionine synthase is one of two eukaryotic enzymes that require a cobalamin prosthetic group for activity. Unlike the other enzyme (|FRAME: EC-5.4.99.2|), which requires adenosylcobalamin, the cobalamin cofactor of methionine synthase needs to be methylated. Upon the initial transfer of a cob(II)alamin cofactor from a |FRAME: CPD-20918|, it is methylated to the active methylcob(III)alamin form by |FRAME: EC-1.16.1.8|, which uses |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| as the methyl donor. The methyl group is subsequently transferred to homocysteine to form methionine, leaving the cofactor briefly in a cob(I)alamin form, which is regenerated to the active methylcob(III)alamin form by a transfer of a methyl group from |FRAME: 5-METHYL-THF-GLU-N "5-methyltetrahydrofolate"| |CITS: [2407589]|.
/
/The enzyme becomes inactivated occasionally during its cycle by oxidation of Co(I) to Co(II). Reactivation by reductive methylation is catalysed by the enzyme itself, with S-adenosyl-L-methionine as the methyl donor and a reducing system. For the mammalian enzyme, the reducing system involves NADPH and |FRAME: EC-1.16.1.8|. In bacteria, the reducing agent is flavodoxin, and no further catalyst is needed (the flavodoxin is kept in the reduced state by NADPH and |FRAME: EC-1.18.1.2|).
/

COMMON-NAME - a monosaccharide
COMMENT - Monosaccharides are polyhydroxy aldehydes or polyhydroxy ketones with three or more carbon atoms. The generic term monosaccharide denotes a single unit, without glycosidic connection to other such units. Monosaccharides with an aldehydic carbonyl group are called aldoses, while those with a ketonic carbonyl carbonyl group are called ketoses.
/
/In addition to aldoses and ketose, the term 'monosaccharide' also includes additional forms, such as dialdoses, alduloses, and diketoses, as well as deoxy and amino monosaccharides, and their derivatives, provided that the parent compound has a (potential) carbonyl group.

UNIQUE-ID - Very-long-chain-fatty-acids
TYPES - Fatty-Acids
COMMON-NAME - a very-long-chain fatty acid
ATOM-CHARGES - (24 -1)
COMMENT - The term "fatty acid" was originally coined to describe aliphatic monocarboxylic acids derived from or contained in esterified form in an animal or vegetable fat, oil or wax. However, over the years the term has been expanded to refer to additional, shorter monocarboxylic acids with an aliphatic tail such as |FRAME: PROPIONATE| and |FRAME: BUTYRIC_ACID| (but not the shorter |FRAME: FORMATE| and |FRAME: ACET|).
/
/The length of a fatty acid is determined by the length of the longest carbon chain, including the carbon of the carboxy group. Common natural fatty acids usually have an even number of carbons in the longest chain and can be either saturated or unsaturated. In many organisms they are often modified by branching, hydroxylation, methylation, epoxidation and other types of modifications.
/
/Inside living cells fatty acids are rarely found in free form. They are usually bound to coenzyme A or acyl-carrier proteins, or form part of |FRAME: Triacylglycerides triglycerides|, |FRAME: Phospholipids phospholipids|, |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides lipopolysaccharides|, and |FRAME: Cholesterol-esters cholesterol esters|.
/
/Many enzymes that act on fatty acids, as well as the corresponding |FRAME: Fatty-Acyl-CoAs "fatty acyl-CoAs"|, alcohols, and aldehydes, have evolved to recognize substrates with a limited range of chain lengths. To classify these enzymes, it is helpful to divide the substrates into smaller groups based on their chain length. The following subgroups have been defined:
/
/|FRAME: Short-chain-fatty-acids "Short-chain fatty acids"| (SCFA) have 3-5 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Medium-chain-fatty-acids "Medium-chain fatty acids"| (MCFA) have 6-12 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Long-Chain-Fatty-Acids "Long-chain fatty acids"| (LCFA) have 13-22 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Very-long-chain-fatty-acids "Very-long-chain fatty acids"| (VLCFA) have 23-27 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/|FRAME: Ultra-long-chain-fatty-acids "Ultra-long-chain fatty acids"| (ULCFA) have more than 27 carbons in the longest chain.
/
/Most of the natural fatty acids have an even number of carbon atoms, since their biosynthesis involves the addition of two-carbon-atom units. When a fatty acid contains only single bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Saturated-Fatty-Acids|. When it contains one or more double bonds, it is referred to as |FRAME: Unsaturated-Fatty-Acids|. If it contains a double bond in the <i>trans</i> configuration, it is often referred to as a <i>trans</i> fatty acid. Most fatty acids in the <i>trans</i> configuration are not found in nature and are the result of human processing.

COMMENT - Cobalamin is the term used for |FRAME: Cobamides| where the cobalt ion is attached to a |FRAME: DIMETHYLBENZIMIDAZOLE| lower axial ligand, without specifying the upper axial ligand. It includes several compounds often referred to as vitamin B12, that differ in the upper axial ligand. The functional forms of the B12 vitamin, |FRAME:CPD-9037| and |FRAME:ADENOSYLCOBALAMIN|, include either a methyl group or an 5'-deoxyadenosyl group as their upper axial ligand, respectively.
/
/Other forms of cobalamin include |FRAME: CPD0-1256| (or its conjugated acid |FRAME: AQUACOBIIIALAMIN|) and |FRAME: CPD-315|. |FRAME: CPD0-1256 Hydroxocobalamin| is a naturally produced form synthesized by many bacterial species, while |FRAME: CPD-315| is a common semi-synthetic form produced from bacterially-synthesized |FRAME: CPD0-1256|. Vitamin B12 pills often contain |FRAME: CPD-315|, which is converted to the active forms in the body.
/
/The cobalt ion embedded in cobalamin may exist in different charges (+1, +2 or +3), and the different forms of the compound are referred to as |FRAME: COB-I-ALAMIN|, |FRAME: CPD-1829| and |FRAME: CPD-17105|, respectively.
/
/Spectroscopic analyses of |FRAME: EC-2.5.1.17|, have revealed that the enzyme binds its cofactor in the "base-off" conformation (in which the lower axial DMB base does notr form a bond with the cobalt atom) in both the Co<sup>2+</sup> and Co<sup>3+</sup> oxidation states |CITS: [15643868]|.

TYPES - Lipoyl-Protein-N6-lipoyllysine
COMMON-NAME - a [2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase E2 protein] <i>N<sup>6</sup></i>-lipoyl-L-lysine
COMMENT - |FRAME: LIPOIC-ACID "Lipoate"| is an organosulfur compound that is used as an essential cofactor by many enzyme complexes. The functional group of lipoate is a ditholane ring, which is a cyclic disulfide.
/
/The enzyme complexes that require lipoate have a dedicated |FRAME: Lipoyl-Protein "lipoyl domain"|, and lipoate is actually produced on this domain. The precursor |FRAME: CPD-195| molecule is first attached to a specific |FRAME: LYS| residue within the lipoyl domain (producing |FRAME: Octanoylated-domains|), and is then converted to lipoate by the enzyme |FRAME: EC-2.8.1.8|, resulting in |FRAME: Lipoyl-Protein-N6-lipoyllysine|.
/
/|FRAME: CPLX0-782 "Lipoate synthase"| not only catalyzes the reaction, but is also the source of the two sulfur atoms (see several pathway variants under |FRAME: Lipoate-Biosynthesis|).

COMMON-NAME - a glycosphingolipid
COMMENT - |FRAME: Glycosphingolipids Glycosphingolipids| are a family of complex lipids composed of |FRAME: Ceramides| and mono- or oligosaccharide moieties that play an important role in various cellular functions including recognition, cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation |CITS: [8490246]|. The lipid portion is embedded in the outer plasma membrane leaflet and the sugar chains extended to the outer environment, acting as an antigen. Together with |FRAME: Glycoproteins glycoproteins| and |FRAME: Glycosaminoglycans glycosaminoglycans|, the glycosphingolipids contribute to the glycocalyx that covers eukaryotic cell surfaces.
/
/Glycoshphingolipids have been classified into the following 12 series based on their structure: |FRAME: Arthro-Series-GSLs arthro|, |FRAME: Gala-Series-GSLs gala|, |FRAME: Ganglio-Series-GSLs ganglio|, |FRAME: Globo-Series-GSLs globo|, |FRAME: Isoglobo-Series-GSLs isoglobo|, |FRAME: Lacto-Series-GSLs lacto|, |FRAME: Muco-Series-GSLs muco|, |FRAME: Mollu-Series-GSLs mollu|, |FRAME: Neogala-Series-GSLs neogala|, |FRAME: Neolacto-Series-GSLs neolacto|, |FRAME: Schisto-Series-GSLs schisto| and |FRAME: Spirometo-Series-GSLs spirometo| |CITS: [25969757]|.
/
/Glycosphingolipids are synthesized by the sequential addition of sugar residues to ceramide by glycosyltransferases that are specific to each glycosidic linkage.
/
/|FRAME: Lactosyl-Ceramides Lactosylceramide|, a product of the second glycosylation step in the biosynthesis of many glycosphingolipids, is an important branching point, being a common precursor for the synthesis of the four major classes of glycosphingolipids: the |FRAME: Ganglio-Series-GSLs "ganglio series"|, the |FRAME: Globo-Series-GSLs "globo series"|, the |FRAME: Lacto-Series-GSLs "lacto series"|, and the |FRAME: Neolacto-Series-GSLs "neolacto series"| |CITS: [10320813]|.

COMMENT - Mercapturic acids are S-conjugates of |FRAME: CPD-9175|, which are formed in the liver and excreted in the urine.
/
/In the process of generating a mercapturic acid, a compound is first conjugated with glutathione. This is followed by loss of the glutamate and glycine portions, followed by acetylation of the L-cysteine nitrogen to form the mercapturic acid.

COMMENT - Fucose is a hexose deoxy sugar. It received its name from the brown algae genus |FRAME: TAX-3011|, from which it was first decribed. The alga was named because of its dark redish color, as one of the meanings of the Latin word <i>fucus</i> is "red paint".
/
/Algae of the |FRAME: TAX-3009| order produce fucose-rich polysaccahrides known as |FRAME: Fucoidans fucoidans|. However, fucose is a common sugar, found in <i>N</i>-linked glycans on the mammalian, insect and plant cell surface, in many bacterial glycans, and in other biomolecules.
/
/Most of the fucose found in biology is in the |FRAME: L-fucoses "L conformation"|, and the use of |FRAME: D-Fucoses| is rather rare (for example in some |FRAME: Cardenolide-Glycosides "cardenolide glycosides"|).
/
/Note that fucose is a reducing sugar that exists in solution in multiple configurations. The open-chain structure shown here is provided only as a schematic illustration of chirality. Consult the appropriate class instances for information on specific ring structures and their anomeric configuration.

COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD-8120 "Di-homo-&gamma;-linolenate"| (dihomo-&gamma;-linolenic acid) is a 20-carbon &omega;-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid with a 20-carbon chain and three <i>cis</i> double bonds at positions 8, 11 and 14.
/
/Di-homo-&gamma;-linolenate is formed by elongation of |FRAME: CPD-8117|, and is usually converted rapidly to other compounds. However, it has been detected in small amounts as a component of cellular lipids in fungi |CITS: [2827674]|, algae |CITS: [Chu80]|, protozoa |CITS: [14216427]|, and animals |CITS: [9237935]|.
/
/Like other fatty acids, |FRAME: CPD-8120| is rarely found in its free form. It is usually found either as |FRAME: CPD-14407| or |FRAME: CPD-17283 "incorporated into a lipid"|.

CHEMICAL-FORMULA - (C 3)
CHEMICAL-FORMULA - (H 8)
CHEMICAL-FORMULA - (O 2)
COMMENT - 1,2-Propanediol (1,2-PDO) occurs in two stereoisomers - |FRAME: PROPANE-1-2-DIOL| and |FRAME: CPD-8891|. Both forms are produced by certain organisms. For example, during the catabolism of 6-deoxyhexoses |CITS: [Suzuki68][16346466]| or during the fermentation of glucose via methylglyoxal |CITS: [Tran-Din85][Cameron86]|. 
/
/1,2-PDO is a bulk industrial chemical with a global demand of around 1.36 million tons/year |CITS: [Shelley07]|. It is widely used in the production of unsaturated polyester resin and as a nontoxic replacement of ethylene glycol in deicer and antifreeze products. Current commercial production of 1,2-PDO is mainly by a synthetic process that results in a racemic mixture.

COMMENT - |FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P "4'-Phosphopantetheine"| is an essential prosthetic group of several acyl carrier proteins involved in pathways of primary and secondary metabolism. These include acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) of fatty acid synthases (FASs), ACPs of polyketide synthases (PKSs) and peptidyl carrier proteins (PCPs), and aryl carrier proteins of |FRAME: Non-ribosomal-peptide-synthetases "non-ribosomal peptide synthetases"|.
/
/The free thiol moiety of |FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P| serves to covalently bind the acyl reaction intermediates as thioesters during the multistep assembly of the monomeric precursors, typically acetyl, malonyl, and aminoacyl groups |CITS: [11489886]|.
/
/The |FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P| moiety is derived from coenzyme A (CoA) and posttranslationally transferred onto an invariant serine side chain by |FRAME: EC-2.7.8.7|, as described by this equation:
/
/|FRAME: HOLO-ACP-SYNTH-RXN|
/
/Organisms often have several such enzymes; for example, |FRAME:TAX-562| have three enzymes, encoded by the |FRAME: EG10247|, |FRAME: EG10262| and |FRAME: EG12221| genes.

COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD-11444 "Uroporphyrinogen-I"| and |FRAME: UROPORPHYRINOGEN-III| are both naturally occurring isomers. The difference between the two is the relative positions of the acetyl and propanoyl side chains on only one of the rings. Where in |FRAME: CPD-11444| the side chains of all four rings have the same relative positions, in |FRAME: UROPORPHYRINOGEN-III| the order is reversed on one of the rings.
/
/While |FRAME: CPD-11444| can be formed spontaneously from |FRAME: HYDROXYMETHYLBILANE|, the formation of |FRAME: UROPORPHYRINOGEN-III| requires a dedicated enzyme - |FRAME: EC-4.2.1.75 "EC 4.2.1.75, uroporphyrinogen-III synthase"|.
/
/Both isomers are substrates for |FRAME: EC-4.1.1.37 "EC 4.1.1.37, uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase"|, although |FRAME: UROPORPHYRINOGEN-III| is a better substrate |CITS: [6724109]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: 5Z8Z11Z14Z17Z-EICOSAPENTAENOATE Icosapentaenoate| (also spelled eicosapentaenoate, or EPA) is a polyunsaturated fatty acid that contains five <i>cis</i> double bonds, one of which is located at the third carbon from the omega end, which makes it an omega-3 fatty acid.
/
/EPA is produced by microalgae and is common in fish who eat the algae, although the fish can not produce it. It is also produced by some marine bacteria, mostly those adapted to low temperatures and high pressures |CITS: [10220156]|. It is not usually found in higher plants, although trace amounts have been identified in |FRAME: TAX-46147|.
/
/Humans require either |FRAME: LINOLENIC_ACID| or EPA to produce |FRAME: CPD-10244|, a primary structural component of the human brain cerebral cortex, sperm, testicles and retina. While humans can not synthesize EPA <i>de novo</i>, they are able to convert the essential fatty acid |FRAME: LINOLENIC_ACID| to EPA.
/
/EPA is also a precursor of different classes of icosanoid effectors involved in the regulation of many important functions in mammals |CITS: [15292371]|. Many of the compounds derived from EPA are listed |FRAME: EPA-Derived-Metabolites here|.
/
/Like other fatty acids, |FRAME: 5Z8Z11Z14Z17Z-EICOSAPENTAENOATE| is rarely found in its free form. It is usually found either as |FRAME: CPD-14018| or |FRAME: CPD-17282 "incorporated into a lipid"|.

COMMENT - Arsenic is the most prevalent environmental toxic substance. It ranks first on the priority list of Hazardous Substances published by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), based on a combination of frequency, toxicity, and potential for human exposure. It is also a Group 1 human carcinogen associated with skin, bladder and lung cancer.
/
/While arsenic exists in two oxidation states, As<sup>III</sup> and As<sup>V</sup>, in aerobic environments most inorganic arsenic is found as As(V), such as |FRAME: ARSENATE|. In anaerobic environments the prevalent form is As(III), such as |FRAME: CPD0-2040|.
/
/While most of the literature refers to the As(III) form found in the environment as |FRAME: CPD-763|, at natural pH values most of the As<sup>III</sup> molecules exist in solution as |FRAME: CPD0-2040|, an inorganic polyol similar to glycerol, since the pKa values are high: pKa<sup>1</sup> = 9:2 and pKa<sup>2</sup> = 12:7 |CITS: [11161507][15106984]|. This form of arsenite can enter cells via glycerol channels such as |FRAME: EG10396 GlpF| of |FRAME: TAX-562| or aquaglyceroporins, bidirectional channels that allow water and small uncharged molecules such as glycerol to pass through.
/
/Charged forms of arsenite, formed at higher pH, include |FRAME: CPD-763 "arsenite<sup>1-</sup>"|, |FRAME: CPD-24319| and |FRAME: CPD-24318|.

COMMENT - Ethylene glycol is commonly used as a coolant, as a deicing fluid, and to produce plastics such as polyethylene terephthalate. Eethylene glycol readily partitions into the aqueous phase, resulting in high mobility and rapid dispersion through the biosphere. Although the toxicity is low |CITS: [11302583]|, acute exposure can result in kidney and brain damage and possibly teratogenesis.

COMMENT - The acid sugar |FRAME: KDO| (known as Kdo for ketodeoxyoctonate) is a component of bacterial |FRAME: Lipopolysaccharides lipopolysaccharides| (LPS) and of the |FRAME: CPD-14581 "rhamnogalacturonan II"| (RG-II) pectin fraction of the primary cell walls of most higher plants, including dicots, monocots and gymnosperms |CITS:[York85][7958328][shin97][9779594]|.
/
/In bacteria Kdo is a part of the inner core of lipopolysaccharides. In the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-562| it is added to the lipid A precursor |FRAME: LIPID-IV-A| |CITS: [1577828]|, while in |FRAME: TAX-287| it is added directly to fully acylated |FRAME: Lipid-A "lipid A"| |CITS: [2833499]|.
/
/In most, but not all, bacteria two Kdo units are added to a lipid molecule (see |FRAME: KDOSYN-PWY|). In some organisms such as |FRAME: TAX-727|, |FRAME: TAX-666| and |FRAME: TAX-520| only one Kdo residue is incorporated (see |FRAME: PWY-7675|), while lipopolysaccharides from members of the |FRAME: TAX-810| genus incorporate three Kdo units (see |FRAME: PWY-6467|). |FRAME: TAX-22| species incorporate an |FRAME: CPD-18063 "aminated form of Kdo"| (see |FRAME: PWY-7676|), while in |FRAME: TAX-469|, |FRAME: TAX-632| and |FRAME: TAX-615| one of the two Kdo units is replaced by |FRAME: CPD-18119| (D-glycero-D-talo-oct-2-ulopynosonate).
/
/When multiple Kdo units are incorporated, they are added by different linkages. The first unit is always added by a (2->6) glycosidic linkage, the second one by a (2->4) linkage, and the third one by a (2->8) linkage.

COMMENT - Nicotinamide is one of three forms of vitamin B<sub>3</sub>: |FRAME: NIACINE|, |FRAME: NIACINAMIDE|, and |FRAME: NICOTINAMIDE_RIBOSE "nicotinamide riboside"| [more accurately named 1-(&beta;-D ribofuranosyl)nicotinamide]. These three forms are interchangeable, and are usually used for the biosynthesis of |FRAME: NAD| |CITS: [Elvehjem38][15137942]|.
/
/|FRAME: NICOTINAMIDE_RIBOSE| can be hydrolyzed to form |FRAME: NIACINAMIDE| by |FRAME: EC-3.2.2.3|
/
/|FRAME: RXN-8441|
/
/and |FRAME: NIACINAMIDE| can be hydrolyzed to |FRAME: NIACINE| by |FRAME: EC-3.5.1.19| (which is not present in humans)
/
/|FRAME: NICOTINAMID-RXN|
/
/
/Eukaryotes and prokaryotes produce NAD <i>de novo</i> from |FRAME: TRP| and |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE|, respectively, by pathways that bypasses vitamin B3 compounds and instead proceed via |FRAME: NICOTINATE_NUCLEOTIDE| (see |FRAME: NADSYN-PWY| and |FRAME: PYRIDNUCSYN-PWY|). Vitamin B3 compounds are used in NAD salvage pathways such as |FRAME: PWY-5381| and |FRAME: PWY3O-4106| |CITS: [13563526][13563527][15137942]|.
/
/In populations with a tryptophan-poor diet the NAD <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis pathway is not sufficient to produce the required NAD, making the salvage pathways that rely on vitamin B<sub>3</sub> compounds the main source of NAD. Under these conditions a difficiency of vitamin B<sub>3</sub> compounds can result in the disease pellagra.

COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD-15302 Platensimycin| (PTM) is a potent and selective inhibitor of the elongation-specific condensing enzymes of type II fatty acid biosynthesis (|FRAME: EC-2.3.1.41| (FabB) and |FRAME: EC-2.3.1.179| (FabF)). The compound, produced by |FRAME: TAX-58346|, was discovered in 2006 by researchers at Merck, using an antisense differential sensitivity screening focused on selective inhibitors of fatty acid biosynthesis |CITS: [16710421]|.
/
/PTM interacts specifically with the acyl-enzyme intermediate of the FabF enzyme. Crystalographic studies have shown that it binds in the malonyl subsite of FabF, with its benzoic acid ring positioned to interact with important residues of the catalytic machinery. Because of its unique mode of action, platensimycin is efficient against notorious antibiotic-resistant strains such as methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA), vancomycin-intermediate <i>S. aureus</i>, and vancomycin-resistant <i>enterococci</i>. PTM is not active against wild-type |FRAME: TAX-562| due to efflux mechanisms, has no antifungal activity, and has low mammalian cell toxicity |CITS: [16710421]|.
/
/The utility of |FRAME: CPD-15302| as a drug is hampered by poor pharmacokinetic properties and negligible
/oral bioavailability. Clinical trials have been delayed pending the development of chemical analogues which have more favorable drug-like properties |CITS: [19164156][18442030][ 26942008]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: ARACHIDONIC_ACID "Arachidonate"| (arachidonic acid) is a polyunsaturated &omega;-6 fatty acid with a 20-carbon chain and four <i>cis</i>-double bonds. It is produced <i>de novo</i> at high levels by mosses (see |FRAME: PWY-5353|), some plants, and by some marine bacteria (see |FRAME: PWY-7583|).
/
/Mammals cannot synthesize |FRAME: ARACHIDONIC_ACID| <i>de novo</i>, but most mammals are able to synthesize it from simpler unsaturated fatty acids (see |FRAME: PWY-7592|).
/
/In mammals |FRAME: ARACHIDONIC_ACID| is present in membrane phospholipids (especially phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylinositides) and is abundant in the brain, muscles, and liver. It accounts for roughly 10-20% of the phospholipid fatty acid content of skeletal muscle cells. In addition to being involved in cellular signaling as a lipid second messenger, arachidonate is also a key inflammatory intermediate and can also act as a vasodilator.
/
/Arachidonate is also a precursor of different classes of icosanoid effectors involved in the regulation of many important functions in mammals |CITS: [15292371]|. Many of the compounds derived from arachidonate are listed |FRAME: Arachidonate-Derived-Metabolites here|.
/
/Like other fatty acids, |FRAME: ARACHIDONIC_ACID| is rarely found in its free form. It is usually found either as |FRAME: ARACHIDONYL-COA| or |FRAME: CPD-17284 "incorporated into a lipid"|.

TYPES - Ketals
COMMON-NAME - methylglyoxal
CHEMICAL-FORMULA - (C 3)
CHEMICAL-FORMULA - (H 4)
CHEMICAL-FORMULA - (O 2)
COMMENT - Methylglyoxal is the aldehyde form of |FRAME: PYRUVATE|. It is both an aldehyde and a ketone, or a ketal.
/
/Methylglyoxal is produced in small amounts during glycolysis, by the enzyme |FRAME:METHGLYSYN-CPLX| that converts |FRAME:DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE| to methylglyoxal.
/It is also a byproduct of fatty acid metabolism (via |FRAME:ACETONE|) and of protein metabolism (via |FRAME:AMINO-ACETONE|, which is formed by the degradation of |FRAME: THR|).
/
/|FRAME: METHYL-GLYOXAL Methylglyoxal| is highly toxic, and is detoxified by several pathways (see |FRAME:Methylglyoxal-Detoxification|).

COMMENT - |FRAME: LINOLEIC_ACID Linoleate| (linoleic acid) is an &omega;-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid with an 18-carbon chain and two <i>cis</i> double bonds at positions 9 and 12.
/
/Linoleate is produced by many organisms, including bacteria, plants, fungi and some insects. It is abundant in many vegetable oils, especially safflower and sunflower oils. While mammals require linoleate, which is found in their membranes and is used as the precursor for production of |FRAME: CPD-8117|, |FRAME: ARACHIDONIC_ACID|, |FRAME: Prostaglandins prostaglandins|, |FRAME: Leukotrienes leukotrienes|, and |FRAME: Thromboxanes thromboxanes|, they are not able to produce it since they lack |FRAME: EC-1.14.19.6|. Thus linoleate is an essential fatty acid, and must be obtained through the diet. Some of the compounds directly derived from linoleate are listed |FRAME: Linoleate-Derived-Metabolites here|.
/
/Like other fatty acids, |FRAME: LINOLEIC_ACID| is rarely found in its free form. It is usually found either as |FRAME: CPD-18| or |FRAME: Linoleoyl-groups "incorporated into a lipid"|.

CHEMICAL-FORMULA - (C 6)

CHEMICAL-FORMULA - (O 6)
COMMENT - |FRAME: Inositols Inositol| is the generic name for 1,2,3,4,5,6-cyclohexanehexol. Epimerization of the six hydroxyl groups results in nine stereoisomers. Among the isomers, |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| is the most abundant in nature and it is an essential compound in eukaryotic cell membranes as a phosphatidylinositol moiety, which plays an important role in signal transduction. Some other forms, such as |FRAME: CPD-8050|, are also found in nature, although they are less abundant.
/
/Nomenclature of cyclitols can be quite confusing. Two alternative naming schemes are possible for inositol compounds since carbon-1 could be assigned to either of two enantiotopic carbons. The two methods result in 1D-stereochemistry and 1L-stereochemistry based names. If carbon-1 is placed at the top of the molecule, L-numbering proceeds clockwise, while D-numbering proceeds counter-clockwise. Both the 1D or 1L designations can be employed currently. However, the symbol Ins implies myo-inositol with D- numbering.
/
/Additional information on the nomenclature of <i>myo</i>-inositol compounds can be found in the 1973 document <A href="http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1974/pdf/3701x0283.pdf">Nomenclature of cyclitols</A> by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry (NC-IUB), and the 1988 publication <A href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbcs/iupac/cyclitol/myo.html">Numbering of atoms in <i>myo</i>-inositol</A>, published by the same body, whose aim was to relax some of the rules specified in the 1973 publication.
/
/To aid in following the transformations in inositol compounds in pathways, the structures of inositol stereoisomers in MetaCyc have been formatted to show carbon 1 at the top of the ring, with numbering proceeding clockwise. An exception is the structure of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL|, which is presented with carbon 3 at the top and counter-clockwise numbering. The reason is that carbon 3 of |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL| (which is based on L-numbering) matches the carbon-1 of 1D numbering, which is used for the various phosphorylated and otherwise modified forms, and by presenting the molecule in this way, it is much easier to show structural relationships in reactions and pathways (see for example |FRAME: MYO-INOSITOL-1-KINASE-RXN "EC 2.7.1.64"|).

COMMENT - |FRAME: FAD "Flavin adenine dinucleotide"| (FAD) is an important redox cofactor involved in many reactions in metabolism. The fully oxidized form, FAD, is converted to the reduced form, |FRAME: FADH2| by receiving two electrons and two protons. The reduced form can be oxidized to a |FRAME: FADH "semireduced form"| (semiquinone, FADH) by donating one electron and one proton. The semiquinone is then oxidized back to the fully oxidized form by losing a second electron and proton.
/Even though FAD has an aromatic ring system, FADH2 does not, making it significantly higher in energy.
/
/Many proteins contain a flavin moiety, either in the form of FAD or |FRAME: FMN|. They are known as |FRAME: Flavoproteins flavoproteins|.

COMMENT - Ketone bodies are carbonyl compounds produced as water-soluble byproducts when fatty acids are broken down for energy in the liver (ketogenesis). There are only three endogenous ketone bodies: |FRAME: 3-KETOBUTYRATE|, |FRAME: CPD-335|, and |FRAME: ACETONE|. Ketone bodies are mostly synthesized in liver mitochondria, but are exported from hepatocytes for circulation to metabolizing tissues. Heart, skeletal muscle under exertion, and brain under starvation conditions use ketone bodies as a major energy source |CITS: [14769483]|.

COMMENT - Vitamin B12 was discovered in the 1920s after Minot and Murphy reported that they could cure the
/symptoms of pernicious anaemia by feeding patients with crude liver extract (they received the
/Nobel prize in 1934 for this discovery) |CITS: [Minot26]|.
/The mysterious factor has been isolated and subsequently crystallized in 1948 |CITS:[Lester48][Rickes48]|,
/and was given the name vitamin B12 and, as it was shown to contain a cobalt ion, cobalamin |CITS: [12195810]|. 
/
/Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is one of the most structurally complex small molecules
/made in Nature. It contains a contracted porphinoid ring with a cobalt ion ligated at its center,
/and further held in place by a lower axial base (a dimethylbenzimidazole) and an upper methyl or
/(as in this case) adenosyl group.
/
/While no eukaryote is able to make cobalamin, the archaea and certain eubacteria possess the
/genes that encode the thirty plus cobalamin biosynthetic enzymes |CITS: [12195810]|.

COMMENT - &gamma;-aminobutyrate (GABA) is a four-carbon non-protein amino acid conserved from bacteria to plants and
/vertebrates.
/GABA was originally discovered in plants in 1949 |CITS: [Steward49]|, but interest shifted to animals when it was
/found that GABA occurs at high levels in the brain, as a neurotransmitter.
/In plants and in animals, GABA is mainly metabolized via a short pathway composed of three enzymes,
/called the GABA shunt because it bypasses two steps of the |FRAME: TCA|.

COMMENT - Galactitol (dulcitol) is an acyclic sugar alcohol with a widespread distribution among plant life |CITS: [15399602][4994959]|. It is found, for example, in seaweed |CITS: [16744712][16652851]| and is the sole constituent of the sugar-rich sticky liquid, secreted by planthoppers of the |FRAME: TAX-30089| family, also known as honeydew or Madagascar Manna.
/
/Glactitol also occurs in the cataractous lenses of galactosemic animals as a metabolic product of galactose, causing a hypertonic condition whereby water is drawn into the lens fibres, which become opaque and may eventually rupture |CITS: [14032902][4691951][26550203]|.

COMMENT - Arsenic is the most prevalent environmental toxic substance. It ranks first on the priority list of Hazardous Substances published by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), based on a combination of frequency, toxicity, and potential for human exposure. It is also a Group 1 human carcinogen associated with skin, bladder and lung cancer.
/
/While arsenic exists in two oxidation states, As(III) and As(V), in aerobic environments most inorganic arsenic is found as As(V), such as arsenic acid. The prevalent form of arsenic acid under neutral pH is |FRAME: ARSENATE arsenate<sup>2-</sup>|.
/
/At neutral pH values arsenate exists mostly in the |FRAME: ARSENATE "AsO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>"| form (pKa<sup>1</sup>= 2:3; pKa<sup>2</sup> = 6:8; and pKa<sup>3</sup> = 11:6) |CITS: [11161507]|.
/
/|FRAME: ARSENATE Arsenate| is chemically similar to phosphate, and enters most cells via phosphate transporters. Once inside cells, arsenate is removed by assorted detoxification mechanisms, described in pathways under |FRAME: Arsenate-Detoxification|.

COMMENT - |FRAME:FMNH2| is the fully reduced form of |FRAME: FMN|.
/
/|FRAME: FMN| is the principal form in which |FRAME: RIBOFLAVIN| (vitamin B2) is found in cells and tissues. While it takes more energy to produce than the non-phosphorylated form of |FRAME: RIBOFLAVIN|, it is more soluble.
/
/FMN is produced from riboflavin by the enzyme riboflavin kinase, and functions as prosthetic group of various oxidoreductases including NADH dehydrogenase. During the catalytic cycle, FMN cycles between the oxidized (FMN), semiquinone (|FRAME: FMNH|) and reduced (|FRAME:FMNH2|) forms, enabling it to take part in both one and two electron transfers. FMN is a stronger oxidizing agent than NAD.

COMMENT - Flavin-<i>N</i><sup>5</sup>-oxides are modified flavin cofactors that are used by some enzymes. Their production involves a two-electron oxidation of an oxidized flavin or four-electron oxidation of a reduced flavin. |FRAME: CPD-22329| was first observed in the EncM-catalyzed 1,3-diketone oxidation in |FRAME: CPD-12319| biosynthesis (see |FRAME: PWY-8063|). Flavin-<i>N</i><sup>5</sup>-oxides were later reported from the catabolic enzymes |FRAME: G6523 RutA| (involved in |FRAME: URACIL| catabolism of |FRAME: TAX-562|) |CITS: [28661684]| and |FRAME: G-494 DszA| (from |FRAME: CPD-942| catabolism of |FRAME: TAX-54064|) |CITS: [ 27120486]|.

COMMENT - Fucose is a hexose deoxy sugar. It received its name from the brown algae genus |FRAME: TAX-3011|, from which it was first decribed. The alga was named because of its dark redish color, as one of the meanings of the Latin word <i>fucus</i> is "red paint".
/
/Algae of the |FRAME: TAX-3009| order produce fucose-rich polysaccahrides known as |FRAME: Fucoidans fucoidans|. However, fucose is a common sugar, found in <i>N</i>-linked glycans on the mammalian, insect and plant cell surface, in many bacterial glycans, and in other biomolecules.
/
/Most of the fucose found in biology is in the |FRAME: L-fucoses "L conformation"|, and the use of |FRAME: D-Fucoses| is rather rare (for example in some |FRAME: Cardenolide-Glycosides "cardenolide glycosides"|).
/
/Note that fucose is a reducing sugar that exists in solution in multiple configurations. The open-chain structure shown here is provided only as a schematic illustration of chirality. Consult the appropriate class instances for information on specific ring structures and their anomeric configuration.

COMMENT - |FRAME: XYLITOL Xylitol| is a naturally occurring pentitol sugar alcohol. It is found in low concentrations in the fibers of many fruits and vegetables, and can be extracted from various berries, oats, and mushrooms, as well as fibrous material such as corn husks, sugar cane bagasse and birch |CITS: [16242318]|. 
/Xylitol is roughly as sweet as sucrose, and is used as a diabetic sweetener. Since it is symmetrical, there are no D or L forms of xylitol.

COMMENT - Thiamin(e), also known as vitamin B1, is known to play a fundamental role in energy metabolism.
/Its discovery followed from the original early research on the anti-beriberi factor found in rice bran. Beriberi, a neurological disease, was particularly prevalent in Asia, where the refining of rice resulted in the removal of the thiamin-containing husk |CITS: [Begley96]|.
/The anti-beriberi substance was crystallized from rice polishings by Jansen and Donath in 1926 |CITS: [Jansen26]|. The structure and synthesis of thiamine were reported by Williams |CITS: [Williams38]|. 
/The compound was named thiamine when it was believed to be an amine. When it became clear that it is not an amine, the 'e' was dropped, and the name was changed to thiamin |CITS:[16550223]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: LINOLENIC_ACID &alpha;-Linolenate| (often referred to as simply linolenate) is a polyunsaturated fatty acid (18:3) that is an important constituent of plant membranes. It is also known as an &omega;-3 fatty acid, referring to the position of the first double bond relative to the methyl end of the fatty acid.
/Seed oils are the richest sources of |FRAME: LINOLENIC_ACID|, especially those of rapeseed (canola), soybeans, walnuts, flaxseed (Linseed), perilla, chia and hemp. It is also common in the lipids that are found in thylakoid membranes in the green leaves of broadleaf plants, and in cyanobacteria and algae |CITS:[4621688][414660]|.
/|FRAME: LINOLENIC_ACID| is an essential fatty acid for animals, and is considered an essential dietary requirement for all mammals. Many of the compounds derived from &alpha;-linolenate are listed |FRAME: ALA-Derived-Metabolites here|.
/
/Like other fatty acids, |FRAME: LINOLENIC_ACID| is rarely found in its free form. It is usually found either as |FRAME: LINOLENOYL-COA| or |FRAME: Alpha-linolenoyl-groups "incorporated into a lipid"|.

COMMENT - Arsenic is the most prevalent environmental toxic substance. It ranks first on the priority list of Hazardous Substances published by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), based on a combination of frequency, toxicity, and potential for human exposure. It is also a Group 1 human carcinogen associated with skin, bladder and lung cancer.
/
/While arsenic exists in two oxidation states, As<sup>III</sup> and As<sup>V</sup>, in aerobic environments most inorganic arsenic is found as As(V), such as |FRAME: ARSENATE|. In anaerobic environments the prevalent form is As(III), such as |FRAME: CPD0-2040|.
/
/While most of the literature refers to the As(III) form found in the environment as |FRAME: CPD-763|, at natural pH values most of the As<sup>III</sup> molecules exist in solution as |FRAME: CPD0-2040|, an inorganic polyol similar to glycerol, since the pKa values are high: pKa<sup>1</sup> = 9:2 and pKa<sup>2</sup> = 12:7 |CITS: [11161507][15106984]|. This form of arsenite can enter cells via glycerol channels such as |FRAME: EG10396 GlpF| of |FRAME: TAX-562| or aquaglyceroporins, bidirectional channels that allow water and small uncharged molecules such as glycerol to pass through.
/
/Charged forms of arsenite, formed at higher pH, include |FRAME: CPD-763 "arsenite<sup>1-</sup>"|, |FRAME: CPD-24319| and |FRAME: CPD-24318|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD-9247 "<i>cis</i>-Vaccenate"| is produced from |FRAME: CPD-9245| by bacteria and plants. It is one of only two unsaturated fatty acids in |FRAME: TAX-562| |CITS: [6988423]| (see |FRAME: PWY-5973|). Some plant species such as |FRAME: TAX-48545| and |FRAME: TAX-73871| (<i>Doxantha unguis-cati</i> L.) produce relatively high levels of |FRAME: CPD-9245| and |FRAME: CPD-9247| in their seed oils |CITS: [CHISHOLMMJ60][CHISHOLMMJ65]|. The plant pathway is likely identical to the bacterial one (in |CITS: [20943853]|).
/
/Like other fatty acids, |FRAME: CPD-9247| is rarely found in its free form. It is usually found as either |FRAME: Cis-vaccenoyl-ACPs "<i>cis</i>-vaccenoyl-[acp]"| or |FRAME: Vaccenoyl-Lipid "incorporated into a lipid"|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP| are dinucleotides containing one |FRAME: NIACINAMIDE| base and one |FRAME: ADENINE| base. Each nucleotide is connected to a ribose sugar at position 1, and the two riboses are connected at their 5 position via a diphosphate. The only difference between the two is that in NADP there is an additional phosphate group at the 2' position of the ribose that carries the adenine moiety.
/
/These molecules are biological carriers of reductive equivalents (i.e. high potential electrons). Most of the time they function as cosubstrates, and in some cases they function as |FRAME: Cofactors cofactors|.  They are often referred to by the obsolete term "coenzymes".
/
/The most common function of |FRAME: NAD| is to accept two electrons and a proton (a hydride ion) from a substrate that is being oxidized. This reduction converts |FRAME: NAD| to |FRAME: NADH|, the reduced form. NADH then diffuses or is transported to a terminal oxidase, where the electrons are passed on, regenerating the oxidized form.
/
/|FRAME: NADPH|, on the other hand, is mostly involved in biosynthetic reactions, where it serves as an electron donor. NADPH is formed by reduction of |FRAME: NADP|, which occurs by different mechanisms in different types of organisms. In photosynthetic organisms |FRAME: NADP| is reduced by |FRAME: CPLX-84|. In heterotrophic organisms it is reduced by central metabolism processes such as the pentose phosphate pathway (see |FRAME: OXIDATIVEPENT-PWY|).

COMMENT - |FRAME: SIROHEME Siroheme| is an iron-containing isobacteriochlorin, a modified tetrapyrrole similar in structure to both heme and chlorophyll that was discovered in 1973 |CITS: [4583265]|. Siroheme is covalently coupled to an iron-sulfur cluster ([FeS]) to form an electronically integrated metallo-cofactor for delivering electrons to substrate.
/Siroheme is found as a prosthetic group of several enzymes, including sulfite and nitrite reductases, which catalyze the six-electron reductions of sulfite to sulfide and nitrite to ammonia, respectively.
/Assimilatory sulfite reductases (see |FRAME: TAX-83333| |FRAME:SULFITE-REDUCT-ENZRXN|) are found in bacteria, fungi and plants but not in animals, while dissimilatory sulfite reductases are found in diverse sulfate-reducing eubacteria (see |FRAME: TAX-879| |FRAME:CPLX-266|) and some species of thermophilic archaebacteria (see |FRAME: TAX-2234| |FRAME: CPLX-7178|) |CITS: [8994874]|.
/
/Siroheme is also an intermediate in the biosynthesis of |FRAME: CPD-17059| in denitrifying bacteria, and in an alternative |FRAME: Heme-b| biosynthesis pathway found in many archaea and sulfate reducing bacteria |CITS: [21969545]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: THF-GLU-N Tetrahydrofolate| (vitamin B9) and its derivatives, commonly termed folates, are required in a variety of reactions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, where they act as carriers of one-carbon units in various oxidation states. These one-carbon units are utilized in the biosynthesis of various cellular components, including glycine, methionine, formylmethionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides.
/
/During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme |FRAME: EC-6.3.2.12|, adds a glutamate residue to |FRAME: 7-8-DIHYDROPTEROATE|, resulting in |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE|, also known as H<sub>2</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>. This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:EC-1.5.1.3| (FolA) to |FRAME: THF| (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>, or tetrahydrofolate), which can be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|.
/
/Most folate molecules are modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming folate polyglutamates (or folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamates). The glutamate residues are added by an amide linkage to the &gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by peptidases or proteases, which are specific for &alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide bonds.
/
/The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives.
/
/The glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis |CITS: [10598551]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: OLEATE-CPD Oleate| (oleic acid) is the first unsaturated fatty acid that is generated from the saturated
/fatty acids produced by the fatty acid synthase. It's name is derived from the olive tree, since it makes up 55-80% of olive oil.
/
/Oleate synthesis occurs with membrane-bound systems. The desaturase enzymes that produce oleate have been isolated from fungi, yeast, and mammalian liver and found to be specific for |FRAME: STEAROYL-COA|. In plants, on the other hand, oleate is produced via |FRAME: Stearoyl-ACPs|, an acyl-carrier-protein bound intermediate |CITS: [4831331]|.
/
/|FRAME: OLEATE-CPD Oleate| has also been reported from a few bacteria, including the obligate anaerobic bacterium |FRAME: TAX-1520| and the saprophytic bacterium |FRAME: TAX-1377|. Bacterial biosynthesis of |FRAME: OLEATE-CPD| does not require oxygen and involves elongation of |FRAME: CPD-17289| |CITS: [14498314][5554109][6886674][12583708][23972938]|.
/
/Like other fatty acids, |FRAME: OLEATE-CPD| is rarely found in its free form. It is usually found as either |FRAME: Oleoyl-ACPs oleoyl-[acp]|, |FRAME: OLEOYL-COA|, or |FRAME: Oleoyl-lipid "incorporated into a lipid"|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: ARACHIDONIC_ACID "Arachidonate"| (arachidonic acid) is a polyunsaturated &omega;-6 fatty acid with a 20-carbon chain and four <i>cis</i>-double bonds. It is produced at high levels by mosses (see |FRAME: PWY-5353|), some plants, and by some marine bacteria (see |FRAME: PWY-7583|).
/
/Mammals cannot synthesize |FRAME: ARACHIDONIC_ACID| <i>de novo</i>, but most mammals are able to synthesize it from simpler unsaturated fatty acids (see |FRAME: PWY-7592|).
/
/In mammals |FRAME: ARACHIDONIC_ACID| is present in membrane phospholipids (especially phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylinositides) and is abundant in the brain, muscles, and liver. It accounts for roughly 10-20% of the phospholipid fatty acid content of skeletal muscle cells.
/
/In addition to being involved in cellular signaling as a lipid second messenger, arachidonate is also a key inflammatory intermediate and can also act as a vasodilator.
/
/Like other fatty acids, |FRAME: ARACHIDONIC_ACID| is rarely found in its free form. It is usually found either as |FRAME: ARACHIDONYL-COA| or |FRAME: CPD-17284 "incorporated into a lipid"|.

COMMENT - This compound represents a membrane attached, nascent peptidoglycan polymer (<i>meso</i>-diaminopimelate containing). It contains an L,D cross link formed between the L-centre of <i>meso</i>-DAP of a peptide on one glycan chain to the D-centre of <i>meso</i>-DAP from a separate glycan chain. The R groups represent glycan chains of &beta;1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid residues with peptide stems of varying length (penta-, tetra- and tripeptide) - some of which may be involved in cross-links with other glycan strands.

COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD-8121 Icosatetraenoate| (also spelled eicosatetraenoate, or ETA) is a polyunsaturated fatty acid that contains four <i>cis</i> double bonds at positions 8, 11, 14 and 17. The last double bond is located at the third carbon from the end of the molecule, making it an &omega;-3 fatty acid.
/
/|FRAME: CPD-8121 Icosatetraenoate| is an intermediate between |FRAME: CPD-12653| and |FRAME: 5Z8Z11Z14Z17Z-EICOSAPENTAENOATE|. It appears to act as as a dual inhibitor of |FRAME: ARACHIDONIC_ACID| oxygenation by both the cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase pathways, and may be responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of |FRAME: TAX-38949| (green-lipped mussels), in which it is found in high concentrations |CITS: [12042477]|.
/
/Like other fatty acids, |FRAME: CPD-8121| is rarely found in its free form. It is usually found as either |FRAME: CPD-14394| or |FRAME: CPD-17281 "incorporated into a lipid"|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP| are dinucleotides containing one |FRAME: NIACINAMIDE| base and one |FRAME: ADENINE| base. Each nucleotide is connected to a ribose sugar at position 1, and the two riboses are connected at their 5 position via a diphosphate. The only difference between the two is that in NADP there is an additional phosphate group at the 2' position of the ribose that carries the adenine moiety.
/
/These molecules are biological carriers of reductive equivalents (i.e. high potential electrons). Most of the time they function as cosubstrates, and in some cases they function as |FRAME: Cofactors cofactors|.  They are often referred to by the obsolete term "coenzymes".
/
/The most common function of |FRAME: NAD| is to accept two electrons and a proton (a hydride ion) from a substrate that is being oxidized. This reduction converts |FRAME: NAD| to |FRAME: NADH|, the reduced form. NADH then diffuses or is transported to a terminal oxidase, where the electrons are passed on, regenerating the oxidized form.
/
/|FRAME: NADPH|, on the other hand, is mostly involved in biosynthetic reactions, where it serves as an electron donor. NADPH is formed by reduction of |FRAME: NADP|, which occurs by different mechanisms in different types of organisms. In photosynthetic organisms |FRAME: NADP| is reduced by |FRAME: CPLX-84|. In heterotrophic organisms it is reduced by central metabolism processes such as the pentose phosphate pathway (see |FRAME: OXIDATIVEPENT-PWY|).

COMMENT - |FRAME: LINOLEIC_ACID Linoleate| (linoleic acid) is an &omega;-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid with an 18-carbon chain and two <i>cis</i> double bonds at positions 9 and 12.
/
/Linoleate is produced by many organisms, including bacteria, plants, fungi and some insects. It is abundant in many vegetable oils, especially safflower and sunflower oils. 
/
/While mammals require linoleate, which is found in their membranes and is used as the precursor for production of |FRAME: CPD-8117|, |FRAME: ARACHIDONIC_ACID|, |FRAME: Prostaglandins prostaglandins|, |FRAME: Leukotrienes leukotrienes|, and |FRAME: Thromboxanes thromboxanes|, they are not able to produce it since they lack |FRAME: EC-1.14.19.6|. Thus linoleate is an essential fatty acid, and must be obtained through the diet.
/
/Like other fatty acids, |FRAME: LINOLEIC_ACID| is rarely found in its free form. It is usually found either as |FRAME: CPD-18| or |FRAME: Linoleoyl-groups "incorporated into a lipid"|.

CHEMICAL-FORMULA - (C 12)

COMMENT - |FRAME: SUCROSE Sucrose| is the major product of photosynthesis in most plants and is known to be essential for their growth, development, carbon storage, signal transduction and stress protection |CITS: [11005202]|.
/Sucrose is also found in cyanobacteria, and the ability to synthesize sucrose is a widespread feature of these organisms |CITS: [21054739]|. In addition, sucrose is produced by many nonphotosynthetic aerobic methanotrophic and methanol-utilizing bacteria |CITS: [1055047][12656177][14529181][23808151][23865613]|.
/
/In photosynthetic organisms, the product of photosynthetic carbon fixation (|FRAME: GAP|) is transported from the chloroplast into the cytoplasm, where it is transformed to hexose phosphate by enzymes of the |FRAME: GLUCONEO-PWY gluconeogenesis| pathway. In plants, these hexose phosphates are used to synthesize sucrose, the form in which most fixed organic carbon is translocated from photosynthetic tissue to non-photosynthetic organs. Sucrose also provides substrates for plant storage glycosides such as |FRAME: Starch starch| and |FRAME: Fructans fructans|. Storage glycosides, including sucrose, are mobilized and utilized during seed germination and plant growth.
/
/In marine and freshwater cyanobacteria sucrose fulfils a different role. It is often synthesized in response to salt or temperature stress and seems to maintain the osmotic balance and to stabilize protein and membrane structure and function |CITS: [Reed86][7854254]|. Methanotrophic and methanol-utilizing bacteria also synthesize sucrose as a secondary osmotic compound, along with the major compatible solute |FRAME: ECTOINE| |CITS: [25577257]|.

COMMENT - (<i>R</i>)-NADHX is a hydrated form of NADH, where the hydroxyl group is attached at position 6 of the nicotinamide moiety in (<i>S</i>) configuration.
/
/Studies in the 1950s have shown that |FRAME: EC-1.2.1.12|, slowly catalyzes the formation of NADHX from NADH |CITS: [Rafter54]|. The equilibrium of this hydration reaction is in favor (100/1) of the hydrated form |CITS: [3061454]|, making the reaction virtually irreversible.
/
/NADHX and NADPHX are inhibitors of several dehydrogenases |CITS: [ 9851831]| and it is thus important to eliminate them. Reconversion of NADHX to NADH is catalyzed by an |FRAME: ENSG00000153481-MONOMER "ATP-dependent dehydratase"| |CITS:[239637][21994945]|.

COMMENT - This is a naturally occurring form of |FRAME: Jasmonic-Acids "jasmonic acid"| |CITS:[8074303][19349968]| in plants.
/
/The |FRAME: Jasmonates jasmonates| are a group of important phytohormones, structurally similar to animal |FRAME: Prostaglandins prostaglandins| and ubiquitous in the plant kingdom. Many forms exist, based on the structure of |FRAME: Jasmonic-Acids "Jasmonate"| (jasmonic acid, JA). The jasmonates act as regulatory molecules in many developmental processes that include fertility, sex determination, root elongation and fruit ripening. They are also potent signals activating plant defences against pathogens, herbivory, wounding and abiotic stress.
/
/The jasmonate regulation system includes the COI1 receptor protein and several JAZ (<b>JA</b>smonate <b>Z</b>IM domain) repressors, which, in the absence of jasmonate, are bound to the MYC2 transcription factors, preventing transcription. In the presence of active jasmonate molecules, COI1 interacts with the JAZ repressors, causing their |FRAME: PWY-7511 ubiquitylation|. The ubiquitylated repressors are targeted for proteasome degradation, releasing the MYC2 transcription factors and activating transcription |CITS: [19716757]|.
/
/Only two of the four stereoisomers of jasmonate occur naturally: |FRAME: CPD-731| and |FRAME: CPD-734| |CITS: [8074303][19349968]|. These two forms are present in equilibrium within cells and can interconvert spontaneously through epimerization |CITS: [8074303][19349968]|. The exact ratio of these stereoisomers within a cell has not been conclusively determined, and it may vary based on species, cell type, and physiological state. But, in the systems tested so far, |FRAME: CPD-734| is found at higher levels than |FRAME: CPD-731| |CITS:[19349968]|. The biological activity of these stereoisomers can be quite different |CITS: [8074303]|. In addition, enzymes involved in JA metabolism may have different preferences for the different stereoisomers |CITS: [17291501]|.

COMMENT - About the nomenclature of histidine: In the past two different systems of numbering the atoms in the imidazole ring of histidine had been used (biochemists numbering the nitrogen atom adjacent to the side chain as 1, while organic chemists designating it as 3), leading to considerable confusion.
/
/To avoid this confusion, IUPAC recommends to denote the nitrogen atoms of the imidazole ring of histidine by <i>pros</i> ('near', abbreviated &pi;) and <i>tele</i> ('far', abbreviated &tau;) to show their position relative to the side chain.
/
/The carbon atom between the two ring nitrogen atoms is numbered 2 (as in imidazole), and the carbon atom next to the &tau; nitrogen is numbered 5. The carbon atoms of the aliphatic chain are designated &alpha; and &beta;.

COMMENT - The most abundant form of the phosphate ion at pH 7.3 is hydrogenphosphate. To simplify the presentation of reactions taking place at physiological pH, MetaCyc does not distinguish between the two forms, and uses the name "phosphate" even though the structure shown is that of hydrogenphosphate.

COMMENT - |FRAME: FMN| is the principal form in which |FRAME: RIBOFLAVIN| (vitamin B2) is found in cells and tissues. While it takes more energy to produce than the non-phosphorylated form of |FRAME: RIBOFLAVIN|, it is more soluble.
/
/FMN is produced from riboflavin by the enzyme |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.26|, and functions as prosthetic group of various oxidoreductases including NADH dehydrogenase. During the catalytic cycle, FMN cycles between the oxidized (FMN), semiquinone (|FRAME: FMNH|) and reduced (|FRAME:FMNH2|) forms, enabling it to take part in both one and two electron transfers. FMN is a stronger oxidizing agent than NAD.

COMMENT - This compound represents a mature peptidoglycan polymer (<i>meso</i>-diaminopimelate containing) that has been released from its site of biosynthesis on the outer face of the inner membrane. It contains an L,D cross link formed between the L-centre of <i>meso</i>-DAP of a peptide on one glycan chain to the D-centre of <i>meso</i>-DAP from a separate glycan chain. The R groups represent glycan chains of &beta;1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid residues with peptide stems of varying length (penta-, tetra- and tripeptide) - some of which may be involved in cross-links with other glycan strands.

COMMENT - Sialic acids are an important family of related 9-carbon sugars acids, present on the surface of many different cells and functioning in a wide range of different biological processes.
/
/<i>N</i>-acetylneuraminate, the most ubiquitous species amongst the sialic acids, is widely distributed in the
/animal kingdom as a component of oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, and glycolipids.
/<i>N</i>-acetylneuraminate carries out various biological functions by acting as receptors for
/microorganisms, viruses, toxins, and hormones, by masking receptors, and by regulation of the immune
/system.
/
/N-acetylneuraminic acid is the predominant form of sialic acid present in humans. It can be found as a terminal sugar on a wide range of surface glycoconjugates |CITS: [11841250]|. The &alpha;-anomer is the form that is found when sialic acid is bound to glycans, but in solution it exists mainly (over 90%) in the &beta;-anomeric form |CITS: [18063573]|. 
/
/A number of bacteria that can colonize humans make use of N-acetylneuraminic acid as a nutrient source. In addition, some pathogens such as |FRAME: TAX-727| use sialic acid in an immune evasion mechanism by adding N-acetylneuraminic acid to their lipopolysaccharide |CITS: [12180977][10447878]|, which provides increased survival in human serum. Most of these organisms are not capable of synthesizing N-acetylneuraminic acid and import it into the cells |CITS: [16262798]| after conversion (either spontaneous or enzymatic) to the &beta;-anomer |CITS: [18063573]| .

COMMENT - Cobalamin is the term used for |FRAME: Cobamides| where the cobalt ion is attached to a |FRAME: DIMETHYLBENZIMIDAZOLE| lower axial ligand, without specifying the upper axial ligand. It includes several compounds often referred to as vitamin B12, that differ in the upper axial ligand. The functional forms of the B12 vitamin, |FRAME:CPD-9037| and |FRAME:ADENOSYLCOBALAMIN|, include either a methyl group or an 5'-deoxyadenosyl group as their upper axial ligand, respectively.
/
/Other forms of cobalamin include |FRAME: CPD0-1256| (or its conjugated acid |FRAME: AQUACOBIIIALAMIN|) and |FRAME: CPD-315|. |FRAME: CPD0-1256 Hydroxocobalamin| is a naturally produced form synthesized by many bacterial species, while |FRAME: CPD-315| is a common semi-synthetic form produced from bacterially-synthesized |FRAME: CPD0-1256|. Vitamin B12 pills often contain |FRAME: CPD-315|, which is converted to the active forms in the body.
/
/The cobalt ion embedded in cobalamin may exist in different charges (+1, +2 or +3), and the different forms of the compound are referred to as |FRAME: COB-I-ALAMIN|, |FRAME: CPD-1829| and |FRAME: CPD-17105|, respectively.

COMMENT - Lactate, or 2-hydroxypropanoate, was discovered in 1780 by the Swedish chemist Scheele, who isolated it from sour milk. It is the simplest hydroxycarboxylic acid and exists as 2 stereoisomers, |FRAME: L-LACTATE| and |FRAME: D-LACTATE|. Lactate has a pK of 3.86 and exists at a lactate ion:lactic acid ratio of 3000:1 at physiological pH |CITS: [15987839]|.
/
/|FRAME: L-LACTATE| has more versatile applications in food, pharmaceutical, textile, and chemical industries than |FRAME: D-LACTATE|. It is also an indispensable monomer for the synthesis of poly-Ll-lactic acid, a bio-degradable polymer.

UNIQUE-ID - TREHALOSE
TYPES - CPD-15990
TYPES - Osmoprotectants
COMMON-NAME - &alpha;,&alpha;-trehalose
CHEMICAL-FORMULA - (C 12)
CHEMICAL-FORMULA - (H 22)
CHEMICAL-FORMULA - (O 11)
COMMENT - The name trehalose was introduced in 1858 to describe a main constituent of shells that are secreted by various insects on tree leaves in the middle east. These shells were often dried and used as a sweetening agents, and are believed to be related to the biblical Manna, the food supplied to the Israelites in their journey through the wilderness of Arabia. One variety of these shells, produced by some beetles from the |FRAME: TAX-202007| genus (<i>Larinus maculatus</i> and <i>Larinus nidificans</i>) was called "trehala manna", and the sugar extracted from it was named trehalique glucose, or trehalose |CITS: [12065209]|.
/
/In fact, |FRAME: TREHALOSE| is a disaccharide that is ubiquitous in the biosphere. It consists of two subunits of glucose bound by their reducing ends in an &alpha;:1-1 linkage (&alpha;-D-glucopyranosyl &alpha;-D-glucopyranoside) and thus does not have a reducing end. Trehalose has been isolated and characterized from many prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, including bacteria, yeast, plants, insects and mammals |CITS: [11081789]|.
/
/In addition to being nonreducing, trehalose possesses several unique properties, including high hydrophilicity, chemical stability, nonhygroscopic glass formation and no internal hydrogen bond formation. The combination of these features explains the principal role of trehalose as a stress metabolite.
/
/In prokaryotic organisms trehalose can be used as external carbon source |CITS: [7651129]|, a compatible solute (in cyanobacteria and photosynthetic bacteria) |CITS: [8480996]|, a stress protector |CITS: [8391102]|, and a structural component (part of the cord factor in mycobacteria) |CITS: [8075141]|. In yeast and filamentous fungi, the main roles of trehalose are as a carbohydrate storage |CITS: [6325857]| and as a stress protector |CITS: [7887593]|. The enzymes for trehalose metabolism are present in higher animals, but their precise role is not well understood |CITS: [11081789]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD-7172 "&Delta;<sup>9</sup>-Tetrahydrocannabinol"| (THC) is the main psychoactive substance found in the cannabis plant. It's presumed role in the plant is self-defense, either against herbivores |CITS: [Pate94]| or as a protectant from UV radiation |CITS: [Pate83]|.
/
/The pharmacological actions of THC result from its binding to the cannabinoid receptors CB1, located mainly in the central nervous system, and CB2, mainly present in cells of the immune system. The natural agonists of these reaceptors are the endocannabinoids |FRAME: CPD-7598|, |FRAME: CPD-12600|, |FRAME: CPD-22217| (noladin ether), |FRAME: CPD-22218|, and |FRAME: CPD-22219|.

COMMENT - Trimethylamine <i>N</i>-oxide (TMAO) is an important constituent of fish muscle and body fluids. In mammals it is believed to promote atherogenesis through its interaction with macrophages and lipid metabolism |CITS: [23563705][23312283][23614584]|. High serum levels of TMAO have been shown to promote formation of atherosclerotic plaques in a mouse model |CITS: [21475195]|, and serum levels of TMAO were significantly correlated with the incidence of heart attack, stroke, and death in a clinical population |CITS: [24497336]|.
/
/In deep-living marine animals TMAO stabilizes intracellular proteins and cell structure for their survival under the high hydrostatic pressure of the deep ocean |CITS: [12443924]|. It is believed that fish cannot survive without TMAO at a depth greater than 5 km |CITS: [24591588]|.
/
/In bacteria the compound serves several roles: it is used as a nitrogen source by the SAR11 clade and the marine |FRAME: TAX-2433| clade of &alpha;-proteobacteria |CITS: [28304370]|, it is used as an electron acceptor by some &gamma;-proteobacteria such as |FRAME: TAX-22| and |FRAME: TAX-662| under anaerobic conditions |CITS: [9813127][11234928]|, and it is accumulated by some deep sea bacteria such as |FRAME: TAX-480520| as a mechanism to cope with the high pressure |CITS: [33771875]|.

COMMENT - 'Heme' is usually understood as any tetrapyrrolic chelate of iron. The terms 'ferroheme' and 'ferriheme' refer to the Fe(II) and Fe(III) oxidation states in heme (even though Fe(IV) is found as a catalytic intermediate in some systems).
/
/Heme <i>a</i> was first isolated in 1951 and shown to be the active component of the integral membrane metalloprotein |FRAME: EC-7.1.1.9| |CITS: [Warburg51]|. The correct structure was published in 1975 |CITS: [170266]|.
/
/The immediate product of the heme biosynthesis pathways (by ferro-chelation of |FRAME: PROTOPORPHYRIN_IX|) is |FRAME: Heme-b "heme <i>b</i>"|, whose |FRAME: PROTOHEME "ferrous form"| is known as protoheme IX. |FRAME: HEME_A "Heme <i>a</i>"| differs from heme <i>b</i> in that a methyl side chain at ring position 8 is oxidized to a formyl group, and a hydroxyethylfarnesyl chain is attached to the vinyl side chain at ring position 2. It is synthesized from |FRAME: Heme-b| via |FRAME: HEME_O|, which lacks the formyl group but contains the hydroxyethylfarnesyl chain, and a short-lived |FRAME: Heme_I| intermediate |CITS: [7885224]|.
/
/|FRAME: HEME_A "Heme <i>a</i>"| is part of |FRAME: A-type-Cytochromes "<i>a</i>-type cytochromes"|. Like in |FRAME: Cytochromes-B "<i>b</i>-type cytochromes"|, heme <i>a</i> is often attached to the apoprotein through a coordinate bond between the heme iron and a conserved amino acid side-chain. Heme <i>a</i> is found exclusively in respiratory oxidases of mitochondria and aerobic bacteria, and all known heme <i>a</i>-containing oxidases belong to the hemecopper superfamily of terminal oxidases |CITS: [808315]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: PYRIDOXAL_PHOSPHATE "Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate"| (PLP, vitamin B6) is an essential cofactor in all living systems |CITS: [7748903]|. It is one of the most versatile cofactors and participates in transamination, decarboxylation, racemization, C&alpha;-C&beta; cleavage and &alpha;-&beta; elimination reactions. PLP plays an important role in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism and has been implicated in singlet oxygen resistance |CITS: [10687384]|.
/
/In most enzymes the aldehyde group of PLP forms a Schiff-base linkage (internal aldimine) with the &epsilon;-amino group of a specific lysine residue at the active site. An amino group of the substrate displaces the &epsilon;-amino group of the active-site lysine residue in a process known as transaldimination. The resulting external aldimine can lose a proton, carbon dioxide, or an amino acid sidechain to become a quinonoid intermediate, which in turn can act as a nucleophile in several reaction pathways. It should be noted that while this is the most common mechanisms, exceptions do occur - for example, |FRAME: EC-2.4.1.1|, which utilizes the phosphate group on PLP to perform its reaction, and |FRAME: EC-4.2.1.168|, which has a histidine instead of a lysine in the active site and converts PLP to the |FRAME: PYRIDOXAMINE-5P| (PMP) form.
/
/Most bacteria, archaea, fungi, and plants synthesize PLP <i>de novo</i> in a single reaction, as described in |FRAME: PWY-6466|. Some bacteria use a longer, more complex pathway (see |FRAME: PYRIDOXSYN-PWY|). However, PLP is often synthesized by salvage pathways.

COMMENT - The imidazole ring is aromatic due to the presence of a sextet of &pi;-electrons, consisting of a pair of electrons from the protonated nitrogen atom and one from each of the remaining four atoms of the ring. Thus the compound exists in several resonance structures.
/
/Imidazole also exists in two equivalent tautomeric forms, |FRAME: IMIDAZOLE-RING| and |FRAME: CPD-19703|. Different numbering systems have been used leading to confusion in the naming of imidazole compounds. When a side chain exists (as in L-histidine), the nitrogen atoms of the ring are denoted by <i>pros</i> ('near', abbreviated &pi;) and <i>tele</i> ('far', abbreviated T) to show their position relative to the side chain.
/
/When a substituent is introduced at positions 4 or 5, the tautomeric character of the molecule precludes a definite numbering of these positions, resulting in names in the form "4(or 5)-substituted imidazole", as in |FRAME: CPD-54 "4(or 5)-aminoimidazole"|. However, when the imino hydrogen is substituted, tautomerism is no longer possible, and the numbering of positions 4 and 5 becomes absolute, as in |FRAME: CPD-19704|.

COMMENT - The nucleotides |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP| (guanosine 3'-diphosphate 5'-diphosphate) and |FRAME: GDP-TP| (guanosine 3'-diphosphate 5'-triphosphate), referred to collectively as (p)ppGpp, have been shown to regulate gene expression during the stringent response in some bacteria.  Their levels become elevated during this response and they are key indicators and regulators of it.  The stringent response is a global regulatory system that operates under conditions of nutrient or energy starvation or other environmental stress.  It has varying effects on gene expression and metabolism.  In addition to bacteria, there is evidence that (p)ppGpp may regulate transcription by plastid-encoded RNA polymerase in plant chloroplasts |CITS: [19308923]|.
/
/Due to its role as an effector molecule in the stringent response in bacteria, (p)ppGpp has been described as a bacterial alarmone.  It can contribute to the regulation of various cellular processes that are affected by nutritional stress such as growth, cell division, motility, adaptation and virulence.  Its effect on the pathogenicity of some bacteria has led to the development of ppGpp analogs as possible antibacterial compounds |CITS: [18776539]| and new <i>in vitro</i> synthesis |CITS: [18789883]| and detection |CITS: [18166051]| methods for ppGpp.  Different bacteria have different ways of synthesizing and responding to (p)ppGpp, many of which are still being discovered.  Even in the well-studied |FRAME:TAX-562| many details of ppGpp action remain to be elucidated.  Reviewed in |CITS: [18454629] [15866041] [18359660]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: KDO| (known as Kdo for ketodeoxyoctonate) is a part of the inner core of lipopolysaccharides. It is added to the lipid A precursor |FRAME: LIPID-IV-A| in sequential steps, with different Kdo units added by different linkages. The first unit is always added by a (2->6) glycosidic linkage and the second one by a (2->4) linkage. The actual donor of Kdo units is its activated form, CMP-Kdo.

COMMENT - |FRAME: MET| (met) is one of the proteinogenic amino acids. In addition to its role in proteins, L-methionine is required for a number of important cellular functions, including the initiation of protein synthesis, the methylation of DNA, rRNA and xenobiotics, and the biosynthesis of cysteine, phospholipids and polyamines.
/
/In all metzoa |FRAME: MET| is an essential amino acid (an indispensable amino acid that cannot be synthesized <i>de novo</i>) and must be supplied in the diet.

COMMENT - |FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P| is an essential prosthetic group of several acyl carrier proteins involved in
/pathways of primary and secondary metabolism. These include acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) of fatty acid
/synthases (FASs), ACPs of polyketide synthases (PKSs) and peptidyl carrier proteins (PCPs), and aryl
/carrier proteins of |FRAME: Non-ribosomal-peptide-synthetases|.
/
/The free thiol moiety of |FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P| serves to covalently bind the acyl reaction
/intermediates as thioesters during the multistep assembly of the monomeric precursors, typically acetyl,
/malonyl, and aminoacyl groups |CITS: [11489886]|.
/
/The |FRAME: PANTETHEINE-P| moiety is derived from coenzyme A (CoA) and posttranslationally
/transferred onto an invariant serine side chain, as described in |FRAME: EC-2.7.8.7 "EC 2.7.8.7"|:
/
/|FRAME: HOLO-ACP-SYNTH-RXN|
/
/This |FRAME:MG+2|-dependent conversion of the apoproteins to the holoproteins is catalyzed by the
/4'-phosphopantetheine transferases.
/Organisms often have several such enzymes; for example, |FRAME:TAX-562| have three enzyes, encoded by
/|FRAME: EG10247|, |FRAME: EG10262| and |FRAME: EG12221|.

COMMENT - This compound represents a peptidoglycan polymer with a tetrapeptide stem (containing a <i>meso</i>-diaminopimeloyl residue at position 3 and glycine at position 4) that has been released from its site of synthesis at the outer face of the inner membrane.  The R group represents a glycan chain of &beta;1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) residues with peptide stems of varying length (penta-, tetra- and tripeptide) - some of which may be involved in cross-links with other glycan strands. One end of the released strand will terminate with 1,6-anyhdroMurNAc (shown here), the other end (not shown here) will terminate with a GlcNAc residue |CITS: [357]|.

COMMENT - Free uric acid is not found in urine. Instead, it is present as |FRAME: CPD-15041| and quadrurate salts |CITS: [Roberts90]|. Excess accumulation of uric acid in the blood can lead to a type of arthritis known as gout, during which needle-like crystals of uric acid salts precipitate in joints, capillaries, skin, and other tissues. Saturation levels of uric acid in blood may also result in formation of sodium urate kidney stones.

COMMENT - Stearate is a saturated fatty acid that occurs in many animal and vegetable fats and oils. It is a large constituent in milk fats, lard, and cocoa and shea butters.
/
/The name comes from Greek for "hard fat", reflecting the fact that stearate forms a waxy solid |CITS: [16477801]|. Stearate was first described by Michel Eugene Chevreul in 1823.
/
/ In cells |FRAME: STEARIC_ACID| is usually found in the form of |FRAME: Stearoyl-ACPs stearoyl-[acp]|, |FRAME: STEAROYL-COA| or |FRAME: Stearoyl-lipid "incorporated into lipids"|.

COMMENT - This compound represents a membrane attached, nascent peptidoglycan polymer (<i>meso</i>-diaminopimelate containing). It contains a D,D cross link formed between the carboxyl group of D-alanine in position 4 of a peptide stem on one glycan chain and the amino group at the D-center of <i>meso</i>-DAP from a separate glycan chain. While the first chain is always a tetrapeptide (the fifth residue, a D-alanine, is released during formation of the cross-link), the second chain may be a pentapeptide, a tetrapeptide, or a tripeptide, depending on prior modifications.
/
/The R groups represent glycan chains of &beta;1,4-linked <i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine and <i>N</i>-acetylmuramic acid residues with peptide stems of varying length (penta-, tetra- and tripeptide) - some of which may be involved in cross-links with other glycan strands.

COMMENT - Cobalamin is the term used for |FRAME: Cobamides| attached to a |FRAME: DIMETHYLBENZIMIDAZOLE| lower axial ligand of the cobalt ion, without specifying the upper axial ligand. It includes several compounds often referred to as vitamin B12, that differ in the upper axial ligand. The functional forms of the B12 vitamin, |FRAME:CPD-9037| and |FRAME:ADENOSYLCOBALAMIN|, include either a methyl group or an 5'-deoxyadenosyl group as their upper axial ligand, respectively.
/
/Other forms of cobalamin include |FRAME: CPD0-1256| (or its conjugated acid |FRAME: AQUACOBIIIALAMIN|) and |FRAME: CPD-315|. |FRAME: CPD0-1256 Hydroxocobalamin| is a naturally produced form synthesized by many bacterial species, while |FRAME: CPD-315| is a common semi-synthetic form produced from bacterially-synthesized |FRAME: CPD0-1256|. Vitamin B12 pills often contain |FRAME: CPD-315|, which is converted to the active forms in the body.
/
/The cobalt ion embedded in cobalamin may exist in different charges (+1, +2 or +3), and the different forms of the compound are referred to as |FRAME: COB-I-ALAMIN|, |FRAME: CPD-1829| and |FRAME: CPD-17105|, respectively.
/
/Cyanocob(III)alamin is a |FRAME: CPD-17105| derivative where the |FRAME: CO+3| ion is held in place partly due to an upper cyano group. The cyano group is an artificial ligand, created as a result of the extraction procedure. It is converted in mammals to active forms of cobalamin by the action of |FRAME: EC-1.16.1.6|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: OXALATE Oxalate| is the most oxidized two-carbon compound. It is made in high concentrations by some plants and fungi and can reach high micromolar concentrations in soil. Oxalate is toxic to mammals but is metabolized by many bacteria and plants by various pathways.
/In high concentrations, it causes death in humans and animals because of its corrosive effects, while smaller amounts can cause various pathological disorders, including hyperoxaluria, calcium oxalate stones, pyridoxine deficiency, and even renal failure.
/
/In oxalate-accumulating plants, calcium oxalate crystal accumulation occurs in specialized idioblast cells. The crystals are thought to deter herbivore feeding |CITS: [16514014]| and may also serve a role in regulating free calcium levels |CITS: [15862089]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| (AdoMet, SAM) is a sulfonium compound in which each of the carbons attached to the sulfur is activated toward nucleophilic attack. It is the most common methyl group donor for methyltransferase enzymes. In addition, AdoMet is cleaved reductively by a large number of iron-sulfur cluster-containing enzymes (known as radical SAM or radical AdoMet enzymes) to produce |FRAME: CPD-15400|, which they use to activate their substrates.
/
/Another major role of AdoMet is in polyamine biosynthesis, where it is decarboxylated by |FRAME: EC-4.1.1.50|, to form |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINAMINE|, which serves as a propylamine group donor.
/
/AdoMet is formed by |FRAME: EC-2.5.1.6| and bears an <i>S</i> configuration at the sulfur atom. The chiral sulfonium of AdoMet spontaneously racemizes under physiological conditions to form a mixture of <i>S</i> and <i>R</i> isomers. This results in reduced activity, as the |FRAME: CPD0-2554 "<i>R</i> isomer"| is not accepted as a substrate for AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases |CITS: [12419350]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: THF-GLU-N Tetrahydrofolate| (vitamin B9) and its derivatives, commonly termed folates, are required in a variety of reactions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, where they act as carriers of one-carbon units in various oxidation states. These one-carbon units are utilized in the biosynthesis of several cellular components, including glycine, methionine, formylmethionine, thymidylate, pantothenate and purine nucleotides.
/
/During folate biosynthesis (as described in |FRAME:FOLSYN-PWY|) the enzyme |FRAME: EC-6.3.2.12|, adds a glutamate residue to |FRAME: 7-8-DIHYDROPTEROATE|, resulting in |FRAME: DIHYDROFOLATE|, also known as H<sub>2</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>. This molecule in turn is reduced by |FRAME:EC-1.5.1.3| (FolA) to |FRAME: THF| (H<sub>4</sub>PteGlu<sub>1</sub>, or tetrahydrofolate), which can be converted to several other folate molecules |CITS: [11501996]|.
/
/Most folate molecules are modified in cells by successive additions of glutamate residues, forming folate polyglutamates (or folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamates). The glutamate residues are added by an amide linkage to the &gamma;-carboxylate group of the folate or folate derivative. Since these isopeptide bonds are not the normal amide bonds they are not hydrolyzed by peptidases or proteases, which are specific for &alpha;-carboxyl-linked peptide bonds.
/
/The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives.
/
/The glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell, it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis |CITS: [10598551]|.

COMMENT - Diacetyl is an important flavor component in many fermented foods and beverages, including dairy and dairy-like
/products, beer and wine |CITS: [15454314]|.
/It imparts a buttery aroma and flavour, and has an important stylistic role in wine. In beer, diacetyl is considered
/a spoilage factor. During beer maturation, 2-acetolactate is slowly converted to diacetyl by a chemical,
/non-enzymatic process, and the diacetyl is converted to acetoin by diacetyl reductase of the yeast cells. for this
/purpose, purified enzyme is sometimes added to the wort |CITS: [2198252]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: BIOTIN "Biotin"| is a water soluble, heterocyclic cofactor for a small number of enzymes that facilitate the transfer of CO<sub>2</sub> during carboxylation, decarboxylation and transcarboxylation reactions involved in fatty acid and carbohydrate metabolism |CITS: [SHELLHAMMER90][11706201][15012185]|. The biotin-requiring enzymes identified so far (including |FRAME: ACETYL-COA-CARBOXYLMULTI-CPLX|, |FRAME: CPLX66-17|, |FRAME: CPLX-5203|, and |FRAME: CPLX-6001|) play essential roles in cell metabolism |CITS: [8676868]|. Humans and other mammals cannot synthesize biotin and thus must obtain it from exogenous sources via intestinal absorption.
/
/Biotin was first discovered at the turn of the 20th century as a yeast growth factor, and was named bios |CITS: [Wildiers01]|. 30 years later, the compound was purified from egg yolk by Koegl and Toennis |CITS: [Koegl36]|. In a completely unrelated research, Gyoergy and his colleagues discovered biotin in liver in 1931, and isolated it in 1941. They named it vitamin H (for the German word for skin: Haut) |CITS: [Vigneaud41]|. At the same time, another group, which was working on <i>Rhizobia</i> bacteria, also identified it as an essential cofactor, which they named coenzyme R |CITS: [Allison38]|.
/
/Already in 1933, Gyoergy suggested that coenzyme R, bios and vitamin H were all the same molecule. The structure of biotin was solved in 1941 -1942 |CITS: [Vigneaud41B][Melville42]|. In 1949 the first evidence was published demonstrating the biochemical role of biotin in carboxylation reactions, |CITS: [Lardy49]|, and in 1958 it was suggested that biotin was probably associated with an enzyme |CITS: [13560478]|. Shortly after this finding, Lynen et al |CITS: [Lynen61]| described biotin's biological function as a cofactor in the biotin-dependent carboxylases.

COMMENT - |FRAME: THIAMINE Thiamin(e)|, also known as vitamin B1, is known to play a fundamental role in energy metabolism.
/Its discovery followed from the original early research on the anti-beriberi factor found in rice bran. Beriberi, a neurological disease, was particularly prevalent in Asia, where the refining of rice resulted in the removal of the thiamin-containing husk |CITS: [Begley96]|.
/The anti-beriberi substance was crystallized from rice polishings by Jansen and Donath in 1926 |CITS: [Jansen26]|. The structure and synthesis of thiamine were reported by Williams |CITS: [Williams38]|. The compound was named thiamine when it was believed to be an amine. When it became clear that it is not an amine, it was suggested to drop the 'e' and change the name to thiamin, although both names are still in use |CITS:[16550223]|.
/
/The active form of the vitamin <i>in vivo</i> is |FRAME: THIAMINE-PYROPHOSPHATE|.

COMMENT - The transition element molybdenum is an essential micronutrient for microorganisms, plants, and animals. Molybdenum itself is catalytically inactive and needs to be complexed by a special cofactor to gain catalytic activity.  It is bound to a unique pterin (molybdopterin, or MPT), forming the molybdenum cofactor, often referred to as MoCo |CITS: [23539623]|.
/
/The MoCo form that is synthesized initially is |FRAME: CPD-15870|. In eukaryotes this form is incorporated into enzymes as-is, or undergoes sulfurylation as described in |FRAME: PWY-5963|. However, in prokaryotes the initial form is modified into many different forms. For example, enzymes of the xanthine oxidase family utilize |FRAME: CPD-23445| (MCD), while enzymes of the DMSO reductase family utilize |FRAME: CPD-15873| (bis-MGD) |CITS: [21528011]|.

COMMENT - Thiols play a major role in the detoxification of stress-inducing factors such as reactive oxygen species, free radicals, peroxides, lipid peroxides, and heavy metals. In mammals, the major thiol is the tripeptide |FRAME: GLUTATHIONE| (&gamma;-Glu-Cys-Gly, known as GSH). Toxins are conjugated to GSH in the liver by a dedicated enzyme, resulting in a |FRAME: S-Substituted-L-Cysteines "cysteine-toxin conjugate"|. The conjugate is acetylated in the kidney to form |FRAME: Mercapturates|, and is then excreted |CITS: [8145281]| (see |FRAME: PWY-4061|).
/In addition to oxidative stress management, low molecular weight thiols have been found to be involved in critical cellular processes including DNA synthesis and formaldehyde reduction |CITS: [Patel98]|.
/
/Gluathione is the major thiol not only in eukaryotic organisms but also in Gram negative bacteria and in the majority of Gram positive bacteria. Pathogenic bacteria live in a particularly hostile environment, in which the host deliberately generates toxins, including reactive oxygen species, to destroy the invading organism, thus thiols are particularly important for the survival of these organisms. 
/
/Despite the ubiquity of GSH, it is not universal. In many organisms, including some eukaryotes, other thiols have taken its role. Some of these thiols are |FRAME: CoM|, |FRAME: TRYPANOTHIONE|, |FRAME: Ergothioneine|, |FRAME: CPD1G-2| and |FRAME: CPD-17028|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: MIMOSINE|, &beta;-(3-hydroxy-4-pyridon-1-yl)-L-alanine, is a non-protein amino acid found in the legume species |FRAME: TAX-76306| and |FRAME: TAX-3866|. It acts as an iron chelator and blocks the mammalian cell cycle at the G1/S phase. Mimosine suppresses the synthesis of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3a (eIF3a or eIF p170) and, subsequently, retards the translation of &alpha;-tubulin |CITS: [Dong04]| and ribonucleotide reductase |CITS: [12972576]|. Chelation of zinc by mimosine is also suggested to affect the function of zinc finger transcription factors, which impede the transcription of cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase (cSHMT), an essential enzyme for deoxyribonucleotide synthesis |CITS: [15531579]|.
/
/|FRAME: TAX-3866| is wide-spread in tropical and subtropical agricultural systems and provides a ready source of protein for livestock. Ruminants from Australia and India are unable to metabolize |FRAME: MIMOSINE| to non-toxic components, but ruminants in Hawaii and Indonesia can consume diets rich in Leucaena without showing any ill effects, due to rapid bacterial degradation of |FRAME: MIMOSINE| in the rumen |CITS: [Megarrity83][Allison92][7871781][7900214][7665380][Pandey07]|. Rumen fluid from Hawaiian goats has been successfully transferred to Australian ruminants to overcome the toxicity of |FRAME: TAX-3866| |CITS: [3790013]|.

/
/The compound was discovered by Edmond Frmy in 1840 in saponified palm oil, of which it is a major
/component, and was named "palmitique".
/
/It is the first fatty acid produced during lipogenesis (fatty acid synthesis). In cells |FRAME: PALMITATE| is usually found in the form of |FRAME: Palmitoyl-ACPs palmitoyl-[acp]|, |FRAME: PALMITYL-COA| or |FRAME: Palmitoyl-lipid "incorporated into lipids"|.

COMMENT - Cholesterol is an important structural component of eukaryotic cell membranes. It is also a precursor of steroid hormones and bile acids. The impact of cholesterol and its regulation on human health is well known. Its role in arteriosclerosis, and drug therapy for this process, has been extensively studied (reviewed in |CITS: [10441607]|).
/Nobel prizes in Physiology or Medicine were awarded to Konrad Bloch in 1963 and to M. S. Brown and J. L. Goldstein
/in 1985 for their work on the metabolism and regulation of cholesterol. Several interesting historical reviews detail the discovery of cholesterol and work leading to the elucidation of its structure and function |CITS: [5319508][1519268][11111073]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP| are dinucleotides containing one |FRAME: NIACINAMIDE| base and one |FRAME: ADENINE| base. Each nucleotide is connected to a ribose sugar at position 1, and the two riboses are connected at their 5 position via a diphosphate. The only difference between the two is that in NADP there is an additional phosphate group at the 2' position of the ribose that carries the adenine moiety.
/
/These molecules are biological carriers of reductive equivalents (i.e. high potential electrons). Most of the time they function as cosubstrates, and in some cases they function as |FRAME: Cofactors cofactors|.  They are often referred to by the obsolete term "coenzymes".
/
/The most common function of  |FRAME: NAD| is to accept two electrons and a proton (a hydride ion) from a substrate that is being oxidized. This reduction converts |FRAME: NAD| to |FRAME: NADH|, the reduced form. NADH then diffuses or is transported to a terminal oxidase, where the electrons are passed on, regenerating the oxidized form.
/
/|FRAME: NADPH|, on the other hand, is mostly involved in biosynthetic reactions, where it serves as an electron donor. NADPH is formed by reduction of |FRAME: NADP|, which occurs by different mechanisms in different types of organisms. In photosynthetic organisms |FRAME: NADP| is reduced by |FRAME: CPLX-84|. In heterotrophic organisms it is reduced by central metabolism processes such as the pentose phosphate pathway (see |FRAME: OXIDATIVEPENT-PWY|).

CHEMICAL-FORMULA - (C 1)

COMMENT - Formate is a one-carbon molecule that was first isolated from distillation of ant bodies, and it was subsequently named using the Latin word for ant, formica |CITS: [Stumper21]|. Ants and other insects accumulate formate in secretory glands and release their content as a mechanism of defense.
/
/Formate serves as an intermediate in one-carbon (1C) metabolism in all organisms. It is also a key metabolite for many bacterial and archaeal species. Depending on the physiological conditions, formate serves various roles, such as to act as a reductant in anaerobic respiration, be oxidized aerobically, be secreted, or be converted to hydrogen and CO<sub>2</sub>.
/
/Formate is particularly common in anaerobic habitats, produced as a fermentation product of some species and used as a growth substrate for others. It is crucial compound in many syntrophic associations, in which organisms live close to the thermodynamic limit (for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria and methanogens) |CITS: [18708519][20844539]|. Its redox potential is low (around -420 mV), which allows it to donate an electron for the reduction of fumarate.
/
/In eukaryotes formate is produced from a variety of nutrients, and can be fed into a number of biosynthetic pathways. A common source of formate is the catabolism of serine or glycine (via tetrahydrofolate). Another important source is formaldehyde, which is formed by many demethylation enzymes and as a degradation product of methanol. Formate is also produced during sterol synthesis, polyamine synthesis, and tryptophan degradation, and is used during purine synthesis, thymidylate synthesis, and as the source of carbon for methylation reactions via folate and methionine (formate can be assimilated into folate by |FRAME: EC-6.3.4.3| and its carbon transferred to methionine by |FRAME: EC-2.1.1.13|. Methionine is then converted to |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE|, the most common methyl group donor) |CITS: [31402327]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: ASCORBATE|, also known as vitamin C, fulfils multiple essential roles in both plants and animals.
/Being a strong reducing agent, it functions as the primary water soluble antioxidant in cells, interacting with reactive oxygen species generated during oxidative stress and protecting cell constituents from oxidative damage |CITS: [    10727845]|.
/
/Ascorbate is also a cofactor for a number of enzymes, particulariy dioxygenases, in which it maintains the reduced form of the Fe cofactor. Ascorbate-dependent enzymes are involved in many important pathways, including collagen hydroxylation, carnitine biosynthesis, norepinephrine biosynthesis, and hormone and tyrosine metabolism.

/In plants L-ascorbate is also implicated in defense against pathogens and in control of plant growth and development.
/A significant proportion of a plants ascorbate is found in the apoplast (the aqueous solution permeating the cell walls) |CITS: [15608627]|.
/
/While most organisms synthesize L-ascorbate, not all do. Examples for organisms that are not able to synthesize L-ascorbate include simians and humans.

COMMENT - The hydroxyl radical is the neutral form of the hydroxide ion (OH).
/Hydroxyl radicals are highly reactive and thus short-lived (half-life of approximately 10<sup>-9</sup> seconds). However, they form an important part of radical chemistry and are very dangerous compounds to a living organism, as they can damage virtually all types of macromolecules.
/
/In biology, hydroxyl radicals are produced most often from the decomposition of hydroperoxides. Unlike |FRAME: SUPER-OXIDE|, the hydroxyl radical cannot be eliminated by an enzymatic reaction.

COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD-19011 "Methyl <i>tert</i>-butyl ether"| (MTBE) is used at large scale since the 1990s as a fuel oxygenate for reducing carbon monoxide emissions in the United States and Europe. In 2003 it was banned from use In California.
/
/This usage, coupled with high incidences of leaking underground storage, tanks,  as led to MTBE contamination of surface waters, groundwater, soils, and sediments |CITS: [Keller98][26616267]|.  MTBE is highly soluble and  persists in contaminated aquifers. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lists MTBE as a possible carcinogen. In addition, one of its biodegradation products, |FRAME: CPD-19012| (TBA), is also a potential carcinogen.
/
/Several bacterial strains were shown to be able to degrade MTBE to a certasin extent |CITS: [9035411][11722912]|. The bacterium |FRAME: TAX-420662|, which was isolated from a compost biofilter at the Los Angeles Joint Water Treatment Plant, can use MTBE as it sole carbon and energy source |CITS: [10543787]|.

CHEMICAL-FORMULA - (AS 1)
COMMENT - Arsenic is the most prevalent environmental toxic substance. It ranks first on the priority list of Hazardous Substances published by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), based on a combination of frequency, toxicity, and potential for human exposure. It is also a Group 1 human carcinogen associated with skin, bladder and lung cancer.
/
/While arsenic exists in two oxidation states, As<sup>III</sup> and As<sup>V</sup>, in aerobic environments most inorganic arsenic is found as As(V), such as |FRAME: ARSENATE|. In anaerobic environments the prevalent form is As(III), such as |FRAME: CPD0-2040|.
/
/While most of the literature refers to the As(III) form found in the environment as |FRAME: CPD-763|, at natural pH values most of the As<sup>III</sup> molecules exist in solution as |FRAME: CPD0-2040|, an inorganic polyol similar to glycerol, since the pKa values are high: pKa<sup>1</sup> = 9:2 and pKa<sup>2</sup> = 12:7 |CITS: [11161507][15106984]|. This form of arsenite can enter cells via glycerol channels such as |FRAME: EG10396 GlpF| of |FRAME: TAX-562| or aquaglyceroporins, bidirectional channels that allow water and small uncharged molecules such as glycerol to pass through.
/
/Charged forms of arsenite, formed at higher pH, include |FRAME: CPD-763 "arsenite<sup>1-</sup>"|, |FRAME: CPD-24319| and |FRAME: CPD-24318|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD-11444 "Uroporphyrinogen-I"| and |FRAME: UROPORPHYRINOGEN-III| are both naturally occurring isomers. The difference between the two is the relative positions of the acetyl and propanoyl side chains on only one of the rings. Where in |FRAME: CPD-11444| the side chains of all four rings have the same relative positions, in |FRAME: UROPORPHYRINOGEN-III| the order is reversed on one of the rings.
/
/While |FRAME: CPD-11444| can be formed spontaneously from |FRAME: HYDROXYMETHYLBILANE|, the formation of |FRAME: UROPORPHYRINOGEN-III| requires a dedicated enzyme - |FRAME: EC-4.2.1.75 "EC 4.2.1.75, uroporphyrinogen-III synthase"|.
/
/Both isomers are substrates for |FRAME: EC-4.1.1.37 "EC 4.1.1.37, uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase"|, although |FRAME: UROPORPHYRINOGEN-III| is a better substrate |CITS: [6724109]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: LIPOIC-ACID "Lipoate"| is an organosulfur compound that is used as an essential cofactor by several important enzyme complexes. The functional group of lipoate is a ditholane ring, which is a cyclic disulfide.
/
/The enzyme complexes that require lipoate have a dedicated lipoyl domain, and lipoate is actually produced on this domain. The precursor |FRAME: CPD-195| molecule is first attached to a specific |FRAME: LYS| residue within the lipoyl domain, and is then converted to lipoate by |FRAME: EC-2.8.1.8|, which is also the source of the two sulfur atoms.
/
/Lipoate can be detached from the enzyme complex by |FRAME: EC-3.5.1.138|, and be re-attached to the complex by |FRAME: EC-6.3.1.20|.
/
/Enzyme known to require lipate include |FRAME:  EC-1.2.1.105|, |FRAME: EC-1.2.1.104|, |FRAME:  EC-1.4.1.27|, |FRAME: EC-1.2.1.25|, and |FRAME: EC-2.3.1.190|.

COMMENT - Stearate is a saturated fatty acid that occurs in many animal and vegetable fats and oils. It is a large constituent in milk fats, lard, and cocoa and shea butters.
/
/The name comes from Greek for "hard fat", reflecting the fact that stearate forms a waxy solid |CITS: [16477801]|. Stearate was first described by Michel Eugene Chevreul in 1823.
/
/ In cells |FRAME: STEARIC_ACID| is usually found in the form of |FRAME: Stearoyl-ACPs stearoyl-[acp]|, |FRAME: STEAROYL-COA| or |FRAME: Stearoyl-lipid "incorporated into lipids"|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD-10244 Docosahexaenoate| (DHA) is a  22-carbon long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) with 6 methylene interrupted <i>cis</i>-double bonds |CITS: [15292371]|. It is prevalent in the membrane lipids of some human tissues such as brain, testis and retina, and plays a critical role in the development and function of these tissues. It is also a precursor of different classes of eicosanoid effectors involved in the regulation of many important functions in mammals |CITS: [15292371]|.
/
/DHA is an <i>n</i>-3 (&omega;-3) fatty acid which is defined according to the location of the last double bond at the methyl end. It is synthesized <i>de novo</i> in several microalgae as well as in some fungi. It is also produced by some marine bacteria, mostly those adapted to low temperatures and high pressures |CITS: [10220156]|.
/
/Mammals are not able to synthesis DHA <i>de novo</i>, and instead synthesize it from the essential fatty acid |FRAME: LINOLENIC_ACID| (which they obtain in their diet) via alternating steps of microsomal aerobic desaturation and elongation |CITS: [11397798][14704315]| followed by a peroxisomal &beta;-oxidation step |CITS: [10903473]|.
/
/Like other fatty acids, |FRAME: CPD-10244| is rarely found in its free form. It is usually found either as |FRAME: CPD-17312| or |FRAME: CPD-17355 "incorporated into a lipid"|.

COMMENT - UDP-glucose is an activated form of glucose that participates in a variety of enzymatic reactions, including:
/
/1. Biosynthesis of glucose-containing compounds, such as polysaccharaides (glycogen, starch, laminarin and cellulose), disaccharides (sucrose, trehalose), &beta;-glucosides, and glucosyl-ceramides.
/
/2. Channeling galactose into the glycolytic pathway
/
/It has also been suggested that UDP-D-glucose can act as an extracellular signaling molecule |CITS: [12695547]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD0-2472| is a hydrated form of |FRAME: NADH|, where the hydroxyl group is attached at position 6 of the nicotinamide moiety in (<i>R</i>) configuration.
/
/Studies in the 1950s have shown that |FRAME: EC-1.2.1.12|, slowly catalyzes the formation of NADHX from NADH |CITS: [Rafter54]|. The equilibrium of this hydration reaction is in favor (100/1) of the hydrated form |CITS: [3061454]|, making the reaction virtually irreversible.
/
/NADHX and NADPHX are inhibitors of several dehydrogenases |CITS: [ 9851831]| and it is thus important to eliminate them. Reconversion of NADHX to NADH is catalyzed by an |FRAME: ENSG00000153481-MONOMER "ATP-dependent dehydratase"| |CITS:[239637][21994945]|.

COMMENT - Many enzymes depend on the sulfo-form of molybdenum cofactor (MoCo). The so called maturation of MoCo involves the addition of sulfur to the Mo center, replacing an oxo group. In eukaryotes this reaction is catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-2.8.1.9| (e.g. the plant ABA3) |CITS: [11553608][15561708]|. However, prokaryotes do not have such an enzyme. In prokaryotes MoCo first binds to a chaperone (such as XdhC) before it is sulfurylated by |FRAME: EC-2.8.1.7|. Many of the prokaryotic molybdoenzymes have a specific chaperone |CITS: [23201473]|. The chaperones interact with the desulfurase, so that MoCo is sulfurated while it is still bound to the chaperone and before the insertion into the target protein. Binding to the chaperone stabilizes the sulfurated form of MoCo. Once sulfurylated, the chaperone transfer the cofactor to its target protein |CITS: [17649978]|.

COMMENT - Cobalamin is the term used for |FRAME: Cobamides| attached to a |FRAME: DIMETHYLBENZIMIDAZOLE| lower axial ligand of the cobalt ion, without specifying the upper axial ligand. It includes several compounds often referred to as vitamin B12, that differ in the upper axial ligand. The functional forms of the B12 vitamin, |FRAME:CPD-9037| and |FRAME:ADENOSYLCOBALAMIN|, include either a methyl group or an 5'-deoxyadenosyl group as their upper axial ligand, respectively.
/
/Other forms of cobalamin include |FRAME: CPD0-1256| (or its conjugated acid |FRAME: AQUACOBIIIALAMIN|) and |FRAME: CPD-315|. |FRAME: CPD0-1256 Hydroxocobalamin| is a naturally-produced form synthesized by many bacterial species, while |FRAME: CPD-315| is a common semi-synthetic form produced from bacterially-synthesized |FRAME: CPD0-1256|. Vitamin B12 pills often contain |FRAME: CPD-315|, which is converted to the active forms in the body.
/
/The cobalt ion embedded in cobalamin may exist in different charges (+1, +2 or +3), and the different forms of the compound are referred to as |FRAME: COB-I-ALAMIN|, |FRAME: CPD-1829| and |FRAME: CPD-17105|, respectively.

COMMENT - Thiamin(e), also known as vitamin B1, is known to play a fundamental role in energy metabolism.
/Its discovery followed from the original early research on the anti-beriberi factor found in rice bran. Beriberi, a neurological disease, was particularly prevalent in Asia, where the refining of rice resulted in the removal of the thiamin-containing husk |CITS: [Begley96]|.
/The anti-beriberi substance was crystallized from rice polishings by Jansen and Donath in 1926 |CITS: [Jansen26]|. The structure and synthesis of thiamine were reported by Williams |CITS: [Williams38]|. 
/The compound was named thiamine when it was believed to be an amine. When it became clear that it is not an amine, the 'e' was dropped, and the name thiamin was used |CITS:[16550223]|. Today both names are used in the literature.

COMMENT - |FRAME: GLT| is one of the proteinogenic amino acids. It is named after wheat gluten, from which it was described in 1866 by the German chemist Karl Heinrich Ritthausen.
/
/|FRAME: GLT| plays an important role in nitrogen metabolism in the cell. Once cells take up ammonium, it is fixed by incorporation into the TCA cycle intermediate |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE| by |FRAME: EC-1.4.1.4|, forming |FRAME: GLT| |CITS: [13239305]| (an additional ammonium molecule can be fixed into L-glutamate, e.g. by |FRAME: EC-6.3.1.2|, forming |FRAME: GLN| |CITS: [14833423]|). Glutamate then becomes the central source for passing amino groups on to other molecules by the action of transaminase (=aminotransferase) enzymes, distributing nitrogen throughout the cell. For example, glutamate can transfer the amino group to the common metabolites |FRAME: PYRUVATE| and |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID|, forming |FRAME: L-ALPHA-ALANINE| and |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE|, respectively. It has been estimated that glutamate and glutamine provide 75% and 25%, respectively, of all cellular nitrogen |CITS: [30026566]|.
/
/In addition to its protein building role, |FRAME: GLT| is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate nervous system, acting on ionotropic and metabotropic (G-protein coupled) receptors |CITS: [10736372]|.
/
/|FRAME: GLT| interacts with the umami taste receptors, which sense glutamates and nucleotides, imparting "meaty", "savory", and "broth-like" flavor. The monosodium salt of glutamate (MSG), which is found naturally in some foods, is often added to foodstuff for flavoring |CITS: [1679557]|. Although MSG is commnly believed to cause headaches, all scientific studies found no such effect |CITS: [27189588]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: SHIKIMATE "Shikimate"| is an important intermediate in the chorismate biosynthetic pathway. It was first isolated from Japanese star anise. Shikimate is used for the production of some antiviral drugs used to halt the spread of the flu virus, but as a biosynthetic intermediate, it is usually not found in high concentrations in organisms. Shikimate can be easily harvested from the needles of several species of pine trees, and biosynthetic pathways in |FRAME:TAX-562| have been enhanced to obtain sufficient amounts of the metabolite for commercial use.

COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD0-920 Indolmycin| is an antibacterial drug produced by both terrestrial and marine bacteria that exhibits potent antibacterial activity against human pathogens such as |FRAME: TAX-210| |CITS: [11502514]| and mupirocin-, methicillin-resistant |FRAME: TAX-1280| |CITS: [15243028]|. Indolmycin, discovered in 1960 |CITS: [14421508]|, is a structural analog of |FRAME: TRP| and competitively inhibits the bacterial |FRAME: EC-6.1.1.2| |CITS: [786633]|. Organisms that produce indolmycin are resistant to it due to the presence of a resistant tryptophan--tRNA ligase |CITS: [19546369]|.
/Indolmycin has not been tested in humans, although it has been proposed to be tested as a topical treatment for staphylococcal infections.
/
/The indolmycin structure contains an oxazolinone ring in its core, making it of interest to synthetic chemists, and over the years several total synthetic routes have been reported |CITS: [5729561][Takeda80][Dirlam86][Akita90][Witty96][Shue96][11767081][Sutou08]|.
/
/The complete biosynthetic pathway has been described in 2015 |CITS: [25730866]|.

COMMENT - Ketone bodies are carbonyl compounds produced as water-soluble byproducts when fatty acids are broken down for energy in the liver (ketogenesis). There are only three endogenous ketone bodies: |FRAME: 3-KETOBUTYRATE|, |FRAME: CPD-335|, and |FRAME: ACETONE|. Ketone bodies are mostly synthesized in liver mitochondria, but are exported from hepatocytes for circulation to metabolizing tissues. Heart, skeletal muscle under exertion, and brain under starvation conditions use ketone bodies as a major energy source |CITS: [14769483]|.

COMMENT - Ketone bodies are carbonyl compounds produced as water-soluble byproducts when fatty acids are broken down for energy in the liver (ketogenesis). There are only three endogenous ketone bodies: |FRAME: 3-KETOBUTYRATE|, |FRAME: CPD-335|, and |FRAME: ACETONE|. Ketone bodies are mostly synthesized in liver mitochondria, but are exported from hepatocytes for circulation to metabolizing tissues. Heart, skeletal muscle under exertion, and brain under starvation conditions use ketone bodies as a major energy source |CITS: [14769483]|.

UNIQUE-ID - MONOMER0-4342
TYPES - Protein-Modified-Amino-Acids
COMMON-NAME - a [prolipoprotein]-<i>S</i>-1,2-diacyl-<i>sn</i>-glyceryl-L-cysteine
COMMENT - A prolipoprotein contains an N-terminal signal peptide. The protein is synthesized in the cytoplasm and then translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane. The signal peptide possesses positively charged amino acid residues in the N-terminal region and uncharged amino acids in the central hydrophobic region and contains a characteristic consensus sequence called the lipobox in the C-terminal region. The lipobox sequence is Leu-(Ala/Ser)-(Gly/Ala)-Cys, where the first three residues form the C-terminus of the signal peptide. During maturation the signal peptide is removed by cleavage between the (Gly/Ala) and Cys residues, so that the cysteine residue becomes the N-terminal residue.
/
/Due to its hydrophobic region, the signal peptide is embedded in the inner membrane, thus attaching the prolipoprotein to the membrane. In Gram negative bacteria, it is facing the perisplasmic side.
/
/The first step in the maturation of lipoprotein involves the formation of a thioether linkage between the sulfhydryl group of the cysteine residue and diacylglycerol, while still embedded in the membrane. The two fatty acids connected to the diacylglycerol are also inserted into the membrane, resulting in three membrane anchors (the two fatty acids and the signal peptide) |CITS: [27871940]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD-12653 Stearidonate| (SDA) is an &omega;-3 fatty acid, sometimes called moroctic acid.
/In mammals it is biosynthesized (in its |FRAME: CPD-14392| form) from |FRAME: LINOLENOYL-COA| by the enzyme |FRAME: EC-1.14.19.3|.
/
/|FRAME: CPD-12653 Stearidonate| is found in the seed oils of several plants, including hemp, blackcurrant, corn gromwel and echium, where it is produced from |FRAME: CPD-8117| by |FRAME: EC-1.14.19.25|.
/
/|FRAME: CPD-12653 Stearidonate| is also produced by Group 4 cyanobacteria (such as |FRAME: TAX-1148|), where it is esterified at the <i>sn</i>-1 position of glyecrolipids by |FRAME: EC-1.14.19.36|.
/
/Like other fatty acids, |FRAME: CPD-12653| is rarely found in its free form. It is usually found either as |FRAME: CPD-14392| or |FRAME: CPD-17278 "incorporated into a lipid"|.

More than 200 years later, the basic component of these phosphate crystals was named spermine, after the source |CITS: [11537482]|.

CHEMICAL-FORMULA - (C 5)

COMMENT - Isoprene is a volatile compound produced by many plants. The yearly production of isoprene emissions by vegetation is around 600 million tonnes (with half of it coming from tropical broadleaf trees), making it about a third of all hydrocarbons released into the atmosphere |CITS: [Guenther06]|.
/
/Isoprene is incorporated into cell membranes in response to heat stress, and its stabilizing effect confers some tolerance to heat spikes. Its emission increases dramatically with temperature and maximizes at around 40 &deg;C. Thus, it is thought that isoprene protects plants against heat stress |CITS: [17921528]|. It also confers some resistance to reactive oxygen species |CITS: [19183288]|.
/
/Isoprene is a common structural motif in biological polymers, although those compounds (|FRAME: Polyisoprenoids isoprenoids|) are not derived from isoprene, but instead are synthesized from |FRAME: CPD-4211| and its isomer |FRAME: DELTA3-ISOPENTENYL-PP|.
/
/Isoprene is used to produce a diverse range of industrial products including a wide variety of specialty elastomers used in surgical gloves, motor mounts and fittings, rubber bands, golf balls, and shoes. It is also used as a component of Styrene-isoprene-styrene block copolymers that form an essential part of most hot-melt pressure-sensitive adhesive formulations, and of <i>cis</i>-polyisoprene or synthetic rubber, which is used in tire manufacturing |CITS: [Whited2010]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: PRPP "5-Phospho-&alpha;-D-ribose 1-diphosphate"| (PRPP) is an important metabolite required in the biosynthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, the amino acids |FRAME: HIS| and |FRAME: TRP|, and the cofactors NAD and NADP. It is utilized in the biosynthesis of |FRAME: THMPT| in certain archaeal species and in the biosynthesis of |FRAME: CPD1G-1531 "mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex"| in |FRAME: TAX-1773|.
/
/PRPP was discovered in the mid-1950s while searching for an enzyme that converted |FRAME: OROTATE| to |FRAME: UMP| |CITS: [14392173][13525411]|.
/
/The enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of PRPP, |FRAME: EC-2.7.6.1|, is ubiquitous among free-living organisms. So far, only certain obligate intracellular parasites such as some |FRAME: TAX-810| and |FRAME: TAX-780| species are known to lack the gene encoding it. Mammals contain three PRPP synthase-encoding genes, the yeast |FRAME: TAX-4932| contains five, and the plant |FRAME: TAX-3702| contains five genes as well |CITS: [28031352]|.

COMMENT - Selenium is an essential trace element that is crucial for the normal development of bacteria and animals. High concentrations of selenium are however toxic, largely because transporters and enzymes involved in sulfur and sulfo-compound metabolism can often erroneously substitute |FRAME: Elemental-selenium| for sulfur and can misincorporate seleno-amino acids into proteins |CITS: [21913064]|. In humans the safety threshold between acute selenium poisoning (>400 &mu;g/day) and selenium deficiency (<40 &mu;g/day) is very narrow. 
/
/The natural forms of selenium include |FRAME: SELENATE| [Se(VI)], |FRAME: SELENITE| [Se(IV)], |FRAME: Elemental-selenium| [Se(0)], and |FRAME: SE-2| [Se(-II)]. Selenite is the most toxic, while elemental selenium is insoluble and is generally considered to be non-toxic |CITS: [25631289]|. However, selenium rarely occurs in its elemental state in nature. 
/
/Elemental selenium can be formed by certain organisms, usually by reduction of the oxidized forms |FRAME: SELENATE| and |FRAME: SELENITE|. Some bacterial species are known to form selenium nanoparticles that consist of elemental selenium coated by a mixture of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates |CITS: [26801915][32854560][35398797]|.

COMMENT - Arsenic is the most prevalent environmental toxic substance. It ranks first on the priority list of Hazardous Substances published by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), based on a combination of frequency, toxicity, and potential for human exposure. It is also a Group 1 human carcinogen associated with skin, bladder and lung cancer.
/
/While arsenic exists in two oxidation states, As<sup>III</sup> and As<sup>V</sup>, in aerobic environments most inorganic arsenic is found as As(V), such as |FRAME: ARSENATE|. In anaerobic environments the prevalent form is As(III), such as |FRAME: CPD0-2040|.
/
/While most of the literature refers to the As(III) form found in the environment as |FRAME: CPD-763|, at natural pH values most of the As<sup>III</sup> molecules exist in solution as |FRAME: CPD0-2040|, an inorganic polyol similar to glycerol, since the pKa values are high: pKa<sup>1</sup> = 9:2 and pKa<sup>2</sup> = 12:7 |CITS: [11161507][15106984]|. This form of arsenite can enter cells via glycerol channels such as |FRAME: EG10396 GlpF| of |FRAME: TAX-562| or aquaglyceroporins, bidirectional channels that allow water and small uncharged molecules such as glycerol to pass through.
/
/Charged forms of arsenite, formed at higher pH, include |FRAME: CPD-763 "arsenite<sup>1-</sup>"|, |FRAME: CPD-24319| and |FRAME: CPD-24318|.

COMMENT - The nucleotides |FRAME: GUANOSINE-5DP-3DP| (guanosine 3'-diphosphate 5'-diphosphate) and |FRAME: GDP-TP| (guanosine 3'-diphosphate 5'-triphosphate), referred to collectively as (p)ppGpp, have been shown to regulate gene expression during the stringent response in some bacteria.  Their levels become elevated during this response and they are key indicators and regulators of it.  The stringent response is a global regulatory system that operates under conditions of nutrient or energy starvation or other environmental stress.  It has varying effects on gene expression and metabolism.  In addition to bacteria, there is evidence that (p)ppGpp may regulate transcription by plastid-encoded RNA polymerase in plant chloroplasts |CITS: [19308923]|.
/
/Due to its role as an effector molecule in the stringent response in bacteria, (p)ppGpp has been described as a bacterial alarmone.  It can contribute to the regulation of various cellular processes that are affected by nutritional stress such as growth, cell division, motility, adaptation and virulence.  Its effect on the pathogenicity of some bacteria has led to the development of ppGpp analogs as possible antibacterial compounds |CITS: [18776539]| and new <i>in vitro</i> synthesis |CITS: [18789883]| and detection |CITS: [18166051]| methods for ppGpp.  Different bacteria have different ways of synthesizing and responding to (p)ppGpp, many of which are still being discovered.  Even in the well-studied |FRAME:TAX-562| many details of ppGpp action remain to be elucidated.  Reviewed in |CITS: [18454629] [15866041] [18359660]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: CARNITINE| is a zwitterionic, quaternary amine carboxylate that has essential and diverse roles in intermediary metabolism in all living kingdoms.
/
/Carnitine was first discovered in 1905 in muscle extracts, and the name is derived from the Latin word for flesh, Carnis |CITS: [11183736]|. In 1962 it was found that the physiological enantiomer is |FRAME: CARNITINE|, and since then the widespread distribution of L-carnitine has been established in higher and lower eukaryotes, plants, and many microorganisms |CITS: [9706218]|. 
/
/In animals and yeast carnitine is best known for its contribution to fatty acid intracellular trafficking |CITS: [2199593]|. In plants L-carnitine is also associated with fatty acid metabolism, although its exact function is less well understood |CITS: [17988884][30080631]|. Bacteria are not able to synthesize carnitine <i>do novo</i>, but are able to import the compound and use it as an osmoprotectant or to enhance thermotolerance, cryotolerance and barotolerance |CITS: [25787873]|.
/
/|FRAME: CARNITINE| is used in pharmaceutical and nutritional preparations and methods have been described for its production and separation from its |FRAME: D-CARNITINE| enantiomer |CITS: [12191705 ] [9830124]| and reviewed in |CITS: [17910757]|.

COMMENT - This is a naturally occurring form of |FRAME: Jasmonic-Acids "jasmonic acid"| |CITS:[8074303][19349968]| in plants.
/
/The |FRAME: Jasmonates jasmonates| are a group of important phytohormones, structurally similar to animal |FRAME: Prostaglandins prostaglandins| and ubiquitous in the plant kingdom. Many forms exist, based on the structure of |FRAME: Jasmonic-Acids "Jasmonate"| (jasmonic acid, JA). The jasmonates act as regulatory molecules in many developmental processes that include fertility, sex determination, root elongation and fruit ripening. They are also potent signals activating plant defences against pathogens, herbivory, wounding and abiotic stress.
/
/The jasmonate regulation system includes the COI1 receptor protein and several JAZ (<b>JA</b>smonate <b>Z</b>IM domain) repressors, which, in the absence of jasmonate, are bound to the MYC2 transcription factors, preventing transcription. In the presence of active jasmonate molecules, COI1 interacts with the JAZ repressors, causing their |FRAME: PWY-7511 ubiquitylation|. The ubiquitylated repressors are targeted for proteasome degradation, releasing the MYC2 transcription factors and activating transcription |CITS: [19716757]|.
/
/Only two of the four stereoisomers of jasmonate occur naturally: |FRAME: CPD-731| and |FRAME: CPD-734| |CITS: [8074303][19349968]|. These two forms are present in equilibrium within cells and can interconvert spontaneously through epimerization |CITS: [8074303][19349968]|. The exact ratio of these stereoisomers within a cell has not been conclusively determined, and it may vary based on species, cell type, and physiological state. But, in the systems tested so far, |FRAME: CPD-734| is found at higher levels than |FRAME: CPD-731| |CITS:[19349968]|. The biological activity of these stereoisomers can be quite different |CITS: [8074303]|. In addition, enzymes involved in JA metabolism may have different preferences for the different stereoisomers |CITS: [17291501]|.

CHEMICAL-FORMULA - (MG 1)
COMMENT - Many hundreds of enzymes require magnesium ions (Mg<sup>2+</sup>) for their catalytic action, including all enzymes using or synthesizing ATP and those that use other nucleotides to synthesize DNA and RNA. The interaction between magnesium ions and phosphate makes magnesium essential to basic nucleic acid chemistry, and the common ATP molecule is normally found in a chelate with a magnesium ion.
/
/Photosynthetic organisms require Mg for the biosynthesis of chlorophyll, which is essential for photosynthesis. The function of magnesium in the center of the porphyrin ring in chlorophyll is similar to that of iron in the center of the porphyrin ring in heme.
/
/Mg is the fourth-most abundant element in the human body (Ca<sup>2+</sup> > K<sup>+</sup> > Na<sup>+</sup> > Mg<sup>2+</sup>).

COMMENT - This compound represents a peptidoglycan polymer with a pentapeptide stem (<i>meso</i>-diaminopimelate containing) that has been released from its site of synthesis at the inner membrane.  The R group represents a glycan chain of &beta;1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) residues with peptide stems of varying length (penta-, tetra- and tripeptide) - some of which may be involved in cross-links with other glycan strands. One end of the released strand will terminate with 1,6-anhydroMurNAc (shown here), the other end (not shown here) will terminate with a GlcNAc residue |CITS: [357]|.

COMMENT - Five core types (|FRAME: CPD-21362 R1|, |FRAME: CPD-21363 R2|, |FRAME: CPD-21361 R3|, |FRAME: CPD-21364 R4| and |FRAME: CPD-19679 K-12|) have been described for the lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) of |FRAME: TAX-562|, of which the R1 core type occurs most frequently clinical isolates |CITS: [7517766]|.
/
/All core types share the inner core region, which is built up of several |FRAME: KDO| (Kdo) and |FRAME: CPD-21358| (L,D-Hep) residues, but differ in the outer core region, which comprises D-Glc and D-Gal residues, some of which are substituted by D-GlcNAc in some core types |CITS: [10215878][12444988]|. The K-12 core structure is unique as it contains a fourth L,D-Hep residue that is attached to the terminal G-Glc residue and is partially substituted by D-GlcNAc |CITS: [1794130]| (see |FRAME: CPD0-939 here|) although later evidence suggests that the terminal D-GlcNAc moiety attached to the K-12 outer core is derived from |FRAME: C55-PP-GLCNAC-MANNACA lipid II-ECA| via the action of |FRAME: EG11424-MONOMER| |CITS: [10574995]| (see also |CITS: [21983211]|).

COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD-9647 "<i>Di-trans,octa-cis</i>-undecaprenol"|, sometimes referred to as bacternol, was first identified in certain species of Lactobacili |CITS: [5965329]|. 
/
/The compound is biosynthesized in its diphosphorylated from, |FRAME: UNDECAPRENYL-DIPHOSPHATE| (see |FRAME: PWY-5785|). The phosphorylated form acts as a membrane anchor for certain mono- and polysaccharides, and is often involved in the biosynthesis of polysaccharides and in the flipping of external polysaccharides such as peptidoglycan and the lipopolysaccharide O antigens from the cytoplasm to the periplasm.

COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD-22847 Glycolyl-CoA| has been shown to form in rat liver mitochondria by &beta;-oxidation of |FRAME: 4-HYDROXY-BUTYRYL-COA|. It could also be formed by |FRAME: EC-1.2.1.104| from bovine heart, acting on |FRAME: OH-PYR| instead of |FRAME: PYRUVATE| |CITS: [1976013]|.
/
/Glycolyl-CoA was a substrate of |FRAME: EC-2.3.1.7|, from pigeon breast muscle, and also of |FRAME: EC-2.3.3.1|, from pig heart, which condensed it with |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID| |CITS: [1976013]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: DOLICHOL "Dolichol"| is the name given to a family of long-chain polyprenols that contain a varying number of <i>cis</i>-linked isoprene units, terminating with three <i>trans</i>-linked isoprene units. The first (alpha) unit in dolichols is always saturated |CITS: [11442630]|. Additional modifications are found. For example, dolichols from certain halobacteria contain an additional saturation in the terminal (omega) isoprene unit.
/
/This type of dolichol phosphate, which is shorter than those from eukaryotes and contains a saturated terminal (&omega;) isoprene unit, was characterized from the archaebacterium |FRAME: TAX-2246| and is expected to be common in archaebacteria |CITS: [9363431][19348869][21091511]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: OLEATE-CPD Oleate| (oleic acid) is the first unsaturated fatty acid that is generated from the saturated
/fatty acids produced by the fatty acid synthase. It's name is derived from the olive tree, since it makes up 55-80% of olive oil.
/
/Oleate synthesis occurs with membrane-bound systems. The desaturase enzymes that produce oleate have been isolated from fungi, yeast, and mammalian liver and found to be specific for |FRAME: STEAROYL-COA|. In plants, on the other hand, oleate is produced via |FRAME: Stearoyl-ACPs|, an acyl-carrier-protein bound intermediate |CITS: [4831331]|.
/
/|FRAME: OLEATE-CPD Oleate| has also been reported from a few bacteria, including the obligate anaerobic bacterium |FRAME: TAX-1520| and the saprophytic bacterium |FRAME: TAX-1377|. Bacterial biosynthesis of |FRAME: OLEATE-CPD| does not require oxygen and involves elongation of |FRAME: CPD-17289| |CITS: [14498314][5554109][6886674][12583708][23972938]|.
/
/Like other fatty acids, |FRAME: OLEATE-CPD| is rarely found in its free form. It is usually found as either |FRAME: Oleoyl-ACPs oleoyl-[acp]|, |FRAME: OLEOYL-COA|, or |FRAME: Oleoyl-lipid "incorporated into a lipid"|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: 5Z8Z11Z14Z17Z-EICOSAPENTAENOATE Icosapentaenoate| (also spelled eicosapentaenoate, or EPA) is a polyunsaturated fatty acid that contains five <i>cis</i> double bonds, one of which is located at the third carbon from the omega end, which makes it an omega-3 fatty acid.
/
/EPA is produced by microalgae and is common in fish who eat the algae, although the fish can not produce it. It is also produced by some marine bacteria, mostly those adapted to low temperatures and high pressures |CITS: [10220156]|. It is not usually found in higher plants, although trace amounts have been identified in |FRAME: TAX-46147|.
/
/Humans require either |FRAME: LINOLENIC_ACID| or EPA to produce |FRAME: CPD-10244|, a primary structural component of the human brain cerebral cortex, sperm, testicles and retina. While humans can not synthesize EPA <i>de novo</i>, they are able to convert the essential fatty acid |FRAME: LINOLENIC_ACID| to EPA.
/
/Like other fatty acids, |FRAME: 5Z8Z11Z14Z17Z-EICOSAPENTAENOATE| is rarely found in its free form. It is usually found either as |FRAME: CPD-14018| or |FRAME: CPD-17282 "incorporated into a lipid"|.

Riboflavin is also known as vitamin B2, because it is an essential nutrient and can not be synthesized by mammals.
/
/The name riboflavin is derived from |FRAME: RIBOSE ribose| (the sugar whose reduced form, |FRAME: RIBITOL|, forms part of its structure) and |FRAME: FLAVIN flavin|, the ring-moiety.

COMMENT - |FRAME: NIACINE "Nicotinate"| (niacin, 3-pyridinecarboxylate) is a carboxylic derivative of |FRAME: PYRIDINE| that is found in nature as part of pyridine cofactors (e.g., NAD and NADP) and alkaloids (e.g., |FRAME: NICOTINE| and |FRAME: CPD-12317|).
/
/Nicotinate is one of three forms of vitamin B<sub>3</sub>: |FRAME: NIACINE|, |FRAME: NIACINAMIDE|, and |FRAME: NICOTINAMIDE_RIBOSE "nicotinamide riboside"| [more accurately named 1-(&beta;-D ribofuranosyl)nicotinamide]. These three forms are interchangeable, and are usually used for the biosynthesis of |FRAME: NAD| |CITS: [Elvehjem38][15137942]|.
/
/|FRAME: NICOTINAMIDE_RIBOSE| can be converted to |FRAME: NIACINAMIDE| by |FRAME: EC-3.2.2.3|
/
/|FRAME: RXN-8441|
/
/and |FRAME: NIACINAMIDE| can be hydrolyzed to |FRAME: NIACINE| by |FRAME: EC-3.5.1.19| (which is not present in humans)
/
/|FRAME: NICOTINAMID-RXN|
/
/
/Eukaryotes and prokaryotes produce NAD <i>de novo</i> from |FRAME: TRP| and |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE|, respectively, by pathways that bypasses vitamin B3 compounds and instead proceed via |FRAME: NICOTINATE_NUCLEOTIDE| (see |FRAME: NADSYN-PWY| and |FRAME: PYRIDNUCSYN-PWY|). Vitamin B3 compounds are used in NAD salvage pathways such as |FRAME: PWY-5381| and |FRAME: PWY3O-4106| |CITS: [13563526][13563527][15137942]|.
/
/In populations with a tryptophan-poor diet the NAD <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis pathway is not sufficient to produce the required NAD, making the salvage pathways that rely on vitamin B<sub>3</sub> compounds the main source of NAD. Under these conditions a difficiency of vitamin B<sub>3</sub> compounds can result in the disease pellagra.

COMMENT - The bacterial bag-shaped envelope (sacculus) can resist turgor pressures of 2-5 atmospheres in Gram-negative bacteria, and up to 20 atm in Gram-positive bacteria. This remarkable tensile strength, combined with elasticity, is achieved by the structure of the cell wall's main component, peptidoglycan (also known as "basal structure", "mucopeptide", "glycopeptide", "glycosaminopeptide" and "murein").
/
/Peptidoglycan has been described as a fisherman's net. The mesh of the net is made of two segments of parallel, rather inextensible glycan threads, held together by two small elastic peptide crosslinks allowing the net to expand or shrink |CITS: [10532377]|.
/
/This is the lipid anchored monomer unit of a peptidoglycan with an attached penta peptide that contains <i>meso</i> diaminopimelate.

COMMENT - Taurine is an amino sulfonic acid. The name comes from Taurus (Latin for bull), as it was first isolated from ox bile.
/It is found in high abundance in the tissues of many animals (especially sea animals) and, in lesser abundance, in plants, fungi, and some bacterial species.
/
/Taurine plays several important roles in mammals and is essential to newborns of many species. The main functions of taurine in mammals include bile acid conjugation, detoxification, osmoregulation, membrane stabilization, and regulation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis.

COMMENT - (<i>R</i>)-pantothenate, also called vitamin B5, is the amide between |FRAME: L-PANTOATE| and |FRAME: B-ALANINE|. It is a precursor for the synthesis of the 4'-phosphopantetheine moiety of |FRAME:CO-A| and |FRAME: ACP "acyl carrier protein"| in bacteria and eukaryotes. Only plants and microorganisms (including some eukaryotic microbes, such as |FRAME: TAX-4932|) can synthesize pantothenate <i>de novo</i> - animals require a dietary supplement.

COMMENT - Hypoglycin A is present in a number of plant species including the ackee plant (|FRAME: TAX-259381|) and several species in the genus |FRAME: TAX-4022|, including sycamore (|FRAME: TAX-4026|) |CITS: [FOWDEN73]|. Hypoglycin A causes hypoglycemia and likely stimulates the"vomiting sickness" that is observed in Jamaica |CITS:13144762| (where ackee fruit is the national fruit |CITS: [16099087]|).
/
/Unripe ackee fruits have high levels of hypoglycin A but levels dwindle significantly during ripening and thus allow safe consumption of the mature fruit |CITS: [BROWN]|.

COMMENT - 1-(&beta;-D ribofuranosyl)nicotinamide (often referred to as nicotinamide riboside) is one of three forms of vitamin B<sub>3</sub>: |FRAME: NIACINE|, |FRAME: NIACINAMIDE|, and |FRAME: NICOTINAMIDE_RIBOSE "nicotinamide riboside"| [more accurately named 1-(&beta;-D ribofuranosyl)nicotinamide]. These three forms are interchangeable, and are usually used for the biosynthesis of |FRAME: NAD| |CITS: [Elvehjem38][15137942]|.
/
/|FRAME: NICOTINAMIDE_RIBOSE| can be hydrolyzed to form |FRAME: NIACINAMIDE| by |FRAME: EC-3.2.2.3|
/
/|FRAME: RXN-8441|
/
/and |FRAME: NIACINAMIDE| can be hydrolyzed to |FRAME: NIACINE| by |FRAME: EC-3.5.1.19| (which is not present in humans)
/
/|FRAME: NICOTINAMID-RXN|
/
/
/Eukaryotes and prokaryotes produce NAD <i>de novo</i> from |FRAME: TRP| and |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE|, respectively, by pathways that bypasses vitamin B3 compounds and instead proceed via |FRAME: NICOTINATE_NUCLEOTIDE| (see |FRAME: NADSYN-PWY| and |FRAME: PYRIDNUCSYN-PWY|). Vitamin B3 compounds are used in NAD salvage pathways such as |FRAME: PWY-5381| and |FRAME: PWY3O-4106| |CITS: [13563526][13563527][15137942]|.
/
/In populations with a tryptophan-poor diet the NAD <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis pathway is not sufficient to produce the required NAD, making the salvage pathways that rely on vitamin B<sub>3</sub> compounds the main source of NAD. Under these conditions a difficiency of vitamin B<sub>3</sub> compounds can result in the disease pellagra.

COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD-8117| (GLA) is a polyunsaturated (18:3) &omega;-6 fatty acid (the 6 refers to the position of the first double bond from the methyl end of the fatty acid). It is synthesized from |FRAME: LINOLEIC_ACID| by &Delta;<sup>6</sup> desaturase enzymes. Unlike its precursor, GLA is not an essential fatty acid for animals, since almost all animals possess a &Delta;<sup>6</sup> desaturase enzyme.
/
/GLA is of major importance in animal cells, being the precursor for the synthesis of several &Delta;<sup>6</sup>-desaturated fatty acids, such as |FRAME: ARACHIDONIC_ACID| and |FRAME: 5Z8Z11Z14Z17Z-EICOSAPENTAENOATE| (see |FRAME: PWY-7592|). &Delta;<sup>6</sup>-desaturated fatty acids have roles in the maintenance of membrane structure and function, in the regulation of cholesterol synthesis and transport, in the prevention of water loss from the
/skin, and as precursors of eicosanoids, including prostaglandins and leucotrienes |CITS: [1334266]|.
/
/Like other fatty acids, |FRAME: CPD-8117| is rarely found in its free form. It is usually found either as |FRAME: GAMMA-LINOLENOYL-COA| or |FRAME: Gamma-linolenoyl-groups "incorporated into a lipid"|.

COMMENT - 'Heme' is usually understood as any tetrapyrrolic chelate of iron. The terms 'ferroheme' and 'ferriheme' refer to the Fe(II) and Fe(III) oxidation states in heme (even though Fe(IV) is found as a catalytic intermediate in some systems).
/
/|FRAME: Heme-b "Heme <i>b</i>"|, whose |FRAME: PROTOHEME "ferrous form"| is known as protoheme IX, is the immediate product of the heme biosynthesis pathways (by ferro-chelation of |FRAME: PROTOPORPHYRIN_IX|) and the most abundant heme form. It is found in common proteins such as hemoglobin and myoglobin.
/
/Heme <i>b</i> is part of |FRAME: Cytochromes-B "<i>b</i>-type cytochromes"|.

COMMENT - This compound represents a peptidoglycan polymer with a tetrapeptide stem (<i>meso</i>-diaminopimelate containing) that has been released from its site of synthesis at the inner membrane by the action peptidoglycan lytic endotransglycosylases.  The R group represents a glycan chain of &beta;1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) residues with peptide stems of varying length (penta-, tetra- and tripeptide) - some of which may be involved in cross-links with other glycan strands. One end of the released strand is terminated by 1,6-anhydroMurNAc (shown here), the other end (not shown here) is terminated with a GlcNAc residue |CITS: [357]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: LINOLENIC_ACID| (often referred to as simply linolenate) is a polyunsaturated fatty acid (18:3) that is an important constituent of plant membranes. It is also known as an &omega;-3 fatty acid, referring to the position of the first double bond from the methyl end of the fatty acid.
/Seed oils are the richest sources of |FRAME: LINOLENIC_ACID|, especially those of rapeseed (canola), soybeans, walnuts, flaxseed (Linseed), perilla, chia and hemp. It is also common in the lipids that are found in thylakoid membranes in the green leaves of broadleaf plants, and in cyanobacteria and algae |CITS:[4621688][414660]|.
/|FRAME: LINOLENIC_ACID| is an essential fatty acid for animals, and is considered an essential dietary requirement for all mammals.
/
/Like other fatty acids, |FRAME: LINOLENIC_ACID| is rarely found in its free form. It is usually found either as |FRAME: LINOLENOYL-COA| or |FRAME: Alpha-linolenoyl-groups "incorporated into a lipid"|.

CHEMICAL-FORMULA - (C 2)
CHEMICAL-FORMULA - (H 6)
CHEMICAL-FORMULA - (S 1)
COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD-7670 Dimethylsulfide| (DMS) is a major contributor to the total sulfur emissions to the atmosphere from land and the ocean.
/In marine, estuarine, and salt marsh systems, the main source of DMS is the degradation of |FRAME: SS-DIMETHYL-BETA-PROPIOTHETIN| (DMSP), an osmolyte of many marine algae and certain plants |CITS: [15181109]|. DMSP is readily degraded in a variety of biological systems, including bacterial cultures, salt marsh sediments, and seawater samples containing algae and zooplankton |CITS: [16347732]|. There are two main routes for DMSP degradation, leading to formation of either |FRAME: CPD-7670| or |FRAME: CPD-7672|. Other sources for DMS include the reduction of |FRAME: DMSO|, the methylation of |FRAME: CPD-7671|, and the degradation of sulfur-containing amino acids.
/
/DMS, which is very volatile, is exchanged freely between the ocean and the atmosphere, and is considered the main natural source of sulfur to the atmosphere. Once in the troposphere, DMS is oxidized to |FRAME: SULFATE| and |FRAME: CPD-3746|, which attract water and promote cloud formation and thus influence the climate |CITS: [Charlson87]|. However, up to 90% of the DMS in the ocean is degraded biologically |CITS: [Kiene90]|.
/
/DMS is toxic, and attempts to isolate in pure culture DMS-degrading organisms that can use it as the sole carbon and energy source have been often unsuccessful due to this toxicity. However, several organisms capable of degerading DMS have been isolated over the years. Aerobic bacterial DMS oxidation has been demonstrated in organisms from a few taxonomic domains, including Thiobacillus sp. strain MS1 |CITS: [Sivela80]|, |FRAME: ORG-5989| |CITS: [Kanagawa82]
/[Kanagawa86][2930168][Tanji89][Gould92]|, |FRAME: ORG-6053| |CITS: [1872604][8285684]|, |FRAME: ORG-6050| |CITS: [Debont81]|, |FRAME: ORG-6052| |CITS:[3767349][Suylen86][Suylen87][Smith88a]| and |FRAME:TAX-392484| |CITS:[16535680][17322322]|.
/Anaerobic degradation of DMS has been documented by methanogens |CITS: [11073950]| (see |FRAME: PWY-5258|) and by sulfate-reducing bacteria |CITS: [8074524]|.

While the first chain is always a tetrapeptide (the fifth residue, a D-alanine, is released during formation of the cross-link), the second chain may be a pentapeptide, a tetrapeptide, or a tripeptide, depending on prior modifications.

COMMENT - 'Heme' is usually understood as any tetrapyrrolic chelate of iron. The terms 'ferroheme' and 'ferriheme' refer to the Fe(II) and Fe(III) oxidation states in heme (even though Fe(IV) is found as a catalytic intermediate in some systems).
/
/|FRAME: HEME_A "Heme <i>a</i>"| was first isolated in 1951 and shown to be the active component of the integral membrane metalloprotein |FRAME: EC-7.1.1.9| |CITS: [Warburg51]|. The correct structure was published in 1975 |CITS: [170266]|.
/
/The immediate product of the initial heme biosynthesis pathways (by ferro-chelation of |FRAME: PROTOPORPHYRIN_IX|) is |FRAME: Heme-b "heme <i>b</i>"|, whose |FRAME: PROTOHEME "ferrous form"| is known as protoheme IX. |FRAME: HEME_A "Heme <i>a</i>"| differs from heme <i>b</i> in that a methyl side chain at position 8 of the D ring is oxidized to a formyl group, and a hydroxyethylfarnesyl chain is attached to the vinyl side chain at position 2 of the A ring. It is synthesized from |FRAME: Heme-b| via |FRAME: HEME_O| by two enzymes - |FRAME: EC-2.5.1.141|, and |FRAME: EC-1.17.99.9|. It has been found that the latter acts by two successive hydroxylations, with the first hydroxylation forming a short-lived |FRAME: Heme_I| intermediate |CITS: [7885224][12206660]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP| are dinucleotides containing one |FRAME: NIACINAMIDE| base and one |FRAME: ADENINE| base. Each nucleotide is connected to a ribose sugar at position 1, and the two riboses are connected at their 5 position via a diphosphate. The only difference between the two is that in NADP there is an additional phosphate group at the 2' position of the ribose that carries the adenine moiety.
/
/These molecules are biological carriers of reductive equivalents (i.e. high potential electrons). Most of the time they function as cosubstrates, and in some cases they function as |FRAME: Cofactors cofactors|. They are often referred to by the obsolete term "coenzymes".
/
/The most common function of |FRAME: NAD| is to accept two electrons and a proton (a hydride ion) from a substrate that is being oxidized. This reduction converts |FRAME: NAD| to |FRAME: NADH|, the reduced form. NADH then diffuses or is transported to a terminal oxidase, where the electrons are passed on, regenerating the oxidized form.
/
/|FRAME: NADPH|, on the other hand, is mostly involved in biosynthetic reactions, where it serves as an electron donor. NADPH is formed by reduction of |FRAME: NADP|, which occurs by different mechanisms in different types of organisms. In photosynthetic organisms |FRAME: NADP| is reduced by |FRAME: CPLX-84|. In heterotrophic organisms it is reduced by central metabolism processes such as the pentose phosphate pathway (see |FRAME: OXIDATIVEPENT-PWY|).
